2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"Mr. Speaker, Sir.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,I. INTRODUCTION,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,1. I rise to present the budget for the year 2004-05.,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"2. Every five years, or sometimes sooner, the people of India speak in their collective voice. The message is usually unambiguous and clear. Elections 2004 were no different. The people’s vote against one coalition – and the vote in favour of another coalition – was a vote for change. As the Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, said in his address to the Nation two weeks ago, the people have sought ""a change in the manner in which this country is run, a change in national priorities, and a change in the processes and focus of governance."" I shall make every effort to be true to that mandate.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,II. NATIONAL COMMON MINIMUM PROGRAMME:,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,THE GUIDING LIGHT,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"3. The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) has given to itself, and to the people of this country, a Common Minimum Programme. The Government has since adopted it as the National Common Minimum Programme (NCMP). The programme spells out seven clear economic objectives:",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,(1) maintaining a growth rate of 7 - 8 per cent per year for a sustained period;,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,(2) providing universal access to quality basic education and health;,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"(3) generating gainful employment in agriculture, manufacturing and services, and promoting investment;",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,(4) assuring 100 days’ employment to the breadwinner in each family at the minimum wage;,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,(5) focusing on agriculture and infrastructure;,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,(6) accelerating fiscal consolidation and reform; and,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,(7) ensuring higher and more efficient fiscal devolution.,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"4. The UPA government began its journey in May this year. However, I may note that one-quarter of the year has elapsed and, by the time the Budget is passed and the President gives his assent to the Finance Bill, nearly one-half of the year will be over. There is also an Interim Budget left behind by my predecessor.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"5. The Government has to shift gears; and even if we are able to do so quickly, it would leave us only about six months to achieve our objectives for this year. We have therefore decided to adopt an innovative approach. The Planning Commission has advised the ministries and departments to redefine their priorities and redraw their programmes in accordance with the NCMP. This will necessarily involve some changes in the allocations under each head of expenditure. Besides, new programmes or schemes may have to be launched, and old ones restructured. Under the circumstances, it was considered optimal to allow the ongoing programmes to continue until the Planning Commission completes an exhaustive review and reorients the expenditure pattern to conform to the NCMP objectives. One thing, however, is clear. The Plan resources made available in the Interim Budget will be insufficient. Hence, in addition to the Gross Budgetary Support (GBS) of Rs.135,071 crore provided in the Interim Budget, I propose to provide a sum of Rs.10,000 crore. This, and some other additional allocations, will raise total plan expenditure to Rs.145,590 crore in the Budget Estimates for 2004-05.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,III. FRBM AND THE MACROECONOMIC BACKDROP,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"6. The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM) 2003 has streamlined the Budget presentation process. The Government has demonstrated its commitment to prudent fiscal and financial policies by notifying the Act and the Rules with effect from July 5, 2004. Along with the Budget, a medium-term fiscal policy statement, a fiscal policy strategy statement and a macroeconomic framework statement are being presented to the House.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"7. Under the FRBM Act, I am obliged to wipe out the revenue deficit by 2007-08. However, the NCMP has proposed that we do so by 2008-09. In my view, 2008-09 is a more credible terminal year; it will also coincide with the term of this Government. Hence, I propose to move an amendment to this effect through the Finance Bill. I am committed to implementing the FRBM Act. The elimination of revenue deficit will open up fiscal space up to 3 per cent of GDP for enhanced public investment without undermining fiscal prudence.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"8. The economic fundamentals appear strong and the balance of payments is robust. Although there are short term pressures on prices, the outlook for the year is benign and the Government is fully alert. Growth will be sustained by increased production and value addition in agriculture, a marked improvement in industrial production, and continued buoyancy in the performance of the services sector.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"9. The Government will follow a 5-year road map to achieve the NCMP objective of bringing about rapid growth with stability and equity. Sequencing the measures in an appropriate fashion and continuing the reform process, which ushered in the era of rapid growth, are the main challenges. The Government is committed to strike a fine balance among the three mutually reinforcing objectives of growth, stability and equity.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,IV. ASSAULT ON POVERTY AND UNEMPLOYMENT,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"10. One of our greatest assets is our human resources, our people. Empowering the people, especially the poor, with universal access to education and health, and facilitating their full participation in the growth process through gainful employment, will enhance their welfare. It will also reinforce the growth process itself. This win-win strategy is the keystone of the economic policy framework of the Government.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,Plan reorientation,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"11. I have the benefit of the wise counsel of the Prime Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh. In our scheme of things, the poor will have a first charge not only on the additional sum of Rs.10,000 crore of GBS that I propose to provide today, but also on the entire Plan funds that the Planning Commission will reallocate.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"12. The poor want basic education for their children: we shall provide it, and we shall make sure that the child remains in school for at least eight years. We shall also make sure that the child is not hungry while she or he is at school. The poor want drinking water: we shall ensure that every habitation has an assured source of drinking water. The poor want basic health care, medicines at fair prices and a doctor within a reasonable distance: we shall ensure that the public health system has adequate human and financial resources to provide basic medical care. The poor want jobs for their children: we shall ensure that through higher investments, and through targeted intervention, jobs are available to them.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"13. While the Planning Commission will make the final allocations, I may assure the House that crucial programmes such as Food for Work, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Midday Cooked-Meal Scheme, basic health care, railway moderanisation and safety, Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme, drinking water, investment in agriculture, Provision of Rural amenities in Urban Areas (PURA), roads, and science and technology, including bio-technology, will receive priority and will be provided with additional funds.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,Antyodaya Anna Yojana,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"14. I propose to continue, and expand, the Antyodaya Anna Yojana. At present, 1.5 crore families are covered. These families are provided with 35 kg. of foodgrains per family per month at a highly subsidized price of Rs. 2 per kg. for wheat and Rs.3 per kg for rice. 20.76 lakh tonnes of rice and 17.48 lakh tonnes of wheat were distributed under the Scheme in 2003-04. In the current year, I propose to cover 2 crore families. I expect that the off-take of rice and wheat will increase. Consequently, the Antyodaya Anna Yojana will receive a subsidy of nearly Rs.3500 crore. A provision for this level of expenditure has been included in the allocation for food subsidy of Rs.25,800 crore.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,Public distribution system,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,15. Fair price shops constitute the backbone of the food security system for the poor. We shall address the weaknesses in the system and strengthen public distribution. I shall return to this subject a little later.,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,Food for Work Programme,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"16. Investment and growth will create new job opportunities for our young men and women. Nevertheless, currently there is a need to ensure that unemployment does not take a heavy toll on the poor people. Work has begun on the National Employment Guarantee Act. The object is to guarantee 100 days of employment in a year to one able-bodied person in every poor household. The Bill will take into account the experience gained in Maharashtra. Government will also take care to avoid the pitfalls pointed out by responsible critics. My colleague, the Minister of Labour, expects that he would be able to introduce the Bill in Parliament shortly. Pending the enactment of the new law, I propose to launch a new Food for Work programme in 150 districts classified as most backward and identified as areas in immediate need of such a programme. Allocations under different schemes will be pulled together to support the Food for Work programme. There are substantial funds totalling over Rs.6000 crore under SGRY, SGSY, SJSRY, REGP and PMRY. Depending on the demand for such work, more funds will be allocated in the current year. I expect to increase the allocations substantially over the next four years. Special care will be taken in laying down the guidelines for the programme so that the money and labour expended result in durable and visible assets benefiting the whole community.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"17. The welfare of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes is close to my heart. The allocation for programmes concerning the Scheduled Castes is Rs.1180 crore (an increase from Rs.1137 crore) and for Scheduled Tribes is Rs.1146 crore (an increase from Rs.1087 crore). Other plan schemes such as SGSY, SGRY and IAY also contain specific reservations for beneficiaries belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The reservations range from 50 per cent to 60 per cent.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,Minorities,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"18. Particular attention will be paid to the welfare, especially education, of the minorities. Hence, an additional allocation of Rs.50 crore has been made for the National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,Self-help groups,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"19. Microfinance initiatives are a cost-effective way to take the banking system to the poor. The Self-Help Group (SHG) – bank linkage programme, initiated in 1992, has come a long way. Until March 31, 2004, 1.67 crore families had benefited through 10.79 lakh SHGs financed by banks. While the SHG concept will be promoted vigorously, I am of the view that matured SHGs may be in a position to graduate from consumption or production credit to starting micro-enterprises. An indicative target of credit linking 5.85 lakh SHGs during the period up to March 31, 2007 has been set for NABARD, SIDBI, banks and other agencies.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,V. THRUST AREAS,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"20. Before I deal with other areas of concern on which the Budget will have an impact, let me give you a snapshot of the goals that I have set for myself :",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"• Doubling agricultural credit in three years, accelerating the completion of irrigation projects and investing in rural infrastructure;",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,• Providing farm insurance and livestock insurance;,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"• Improving agricultural product markets, and promoting agri-businesses;",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,• Drinking water for all;,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"• Expanding water harvesting, watershed development and minor- irrigation and micro-irrigation schemes;",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"• Enhancing investment in industry – public and private, domestic and foreign – to create new jobs;",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,• Creating space for small-scale industry to thrive and grow;,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,• Electricity for all;,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,• Universal access to telecommunication facilities;,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,• More housing for the poor;,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,• Access to medical care through health insurance; and,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"• Encouraging savings, and protecting the savings of senior citizens;",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"21. I believe that the key to growth is investment – public and private, domestic and foreign. It is therefore my intention to considerably enhance investment in all sectors of the economy. However, fiscal prudence and financial discipline will remain the overarching objective. I shall also take into account the availability of resources and the absorptive capacity of various sectors.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,VI. EDUCATION AND HEALTH,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,Education,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"22. In my scheme of things, no issue enjoys a higher priority than providing basic education to all children. The NCMP mandates Government to levy an education cess. I propose to levy a cess of 2 per cent. The new cess will yield about Rs.4000 - 5000 crore in a full year. The whole of the amount collected as cess will be earmarked for education, which will naturally include providing a nutritious cooked midday meal. If primary education and the nutritious cooked meal scheme can work hand in hand, I believe there will be a new dawn for the poor children of India.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"23. I am concerned about the quality of technical education in the country. Lest I be misunderstood, I am not referring to the IITs but to the ITIs. ITIs are the training ground for skilled manpower. The skills imparted by ITIs must keep pace with the technological demands of industry and the expanding universe of knowledge. There is only one benchmark for our technicians – and that is the world standard. In order to produce technicians of world standard, Government proposes to launch a programme in the Central sector to upgrade 500 ITIs over the next 5 years at the rate of 100 ITIs a year. Appropriate infrastructure and equipment will be provided, the syllabi will be upgraded and new trades will be introduced. This is an area where I welcome Chambers of Commerce and Industry to join hands with the Government and create a public-private partnership model for designing and implementing the scheme. The selection of the ITIs will be done in consultation with the State Governments.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"24. An education loan scheme has been in operation since April 2001 under which loans up to Rs.7.50 lakh and Rs.15 lakh are available for professional courses within the country and abroad, respectively. The requirement of collateral was dispensed with for loans up to Rs.4 lakh. I am happy to say that commercial banks have now agreed to waive the need for collateral for loans up to Rs.7.5 lakh, if a satisfactory guarantee is provided on behalf of the student. Thus, no student admitted to any professional course, including courses in IITs, IIMs and medical colleges, will be deprived of the opportunity to study because of lack of funds.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,Health,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"25. Access to medical care is not easily available to the poor. The Universal Health Insurance Scheme (UHIS) now in operation is skewed in favour of the non-poor. As a result, only a very small number of families below the poverty line (BPL) – actually 11,408 till May, 2004 – have been covered. Although the premiums are low, BPL families seem to avoid the scheme due to their inability to pay the premium. In its present design, the scheme may not be sustainable. I, therefore, propose to redesign the scheme and make it exclusive for persons and families below the poverty line. The revised premium would be Rs.165 for individuals, Rs.248 for a family of five and Rs.330 for a family of seven, without any reduction in benefits. To offset the reduction in premium, I propose to enhance the premium subsidy from Rs.100 at present to Rs.200 for an individual, Rs.300 for a family of five and Rs.400 for a family of seven. The cost to the exchequer will be Rs.40 crore in a full year. If the money is fully spent, the number insured will rise to about 10 lakh.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"26. In addition to the above, I propose to introduce a new Group Health Insurance Scheme through public sector non-life insurance companies. The insured will be members of Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and other credit linked groups (CLGs) who avail of loans from banks or cooperative institutions. Under the group health insurance scheme, the premium will be Rs.120 per person, but the insurance cover would be for a sum of Rs.10,000.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"27. The NCMP also rightly emphasizes the need for an accelerated AIDS control programme. Bold and determined efforts need to be made to achieve zero-level growth of HIV/AIDS. These will include improved surveillance through the setting up of more sentinel sites and use of primary health centres to monitor HIV/AIDS, public awareness campaigns, promotion of safe sex through the use of condoms, prevention of drug abuse and distribution of disposable syringes. The allocation for prevention and control of HIV/AIDS is Rs. 259 crore.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,VII. AGRICULTURE AND THE RURAL ECONOMY,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"28. Boosting agricultural growth through diversification and development of agro-processing is one of the objectives of the NCMP. The Prime Minister, in his address to the Nation on June 24, 2004 promised a ""New Deal"" for rural India. This New Deal is not only essential for rural development and welfare, but also essential for achieving sustained overall annual growth of 7-8 per cent and generating employment.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,29. The agriculture sector requires massive investments. Such investments have to be through credit-enabled private investment and enhanced public investment. I also intend to use fiscal instruments to boost investment in agriculture.,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,Credit,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"30. It is my intention to double the flow of agricultural credit in three years. We have made a beginning by announcing a comprehensive policy on agricultural credit on June 18, 2004. The policy has been received well and will be fine-tuned, if necessary.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"31. Government has entrusted the implementation of the policy to the public sector and private sector banks, the regional rural banks (RRBs) and the cooperative banks.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,32. Each RRB has a sponsor bank. I propose to hold each sponsor bank squarely accountable for the performance of RRBs under its control. RRBs that adopt a new governance standard and that abide by the prudential regulations will qualify for receiving funds from the Government for their restructuring.,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"33. The third arm for delivering farm credit is the cooperative banking system. Unless cooperative banks are healthy and creditworthy, it would not be possible to reach credit to every farmer in need of credit. The situation is grave. In order to find a durable solution, I propose to appoint a Task Force to examine the reforms required in the cooperative banking system including the appropriate regulatory regime. The Task Force will be requested to act with all deliberate speed and submit its report by October 31, 2004.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"Irrigation, Rural Infrastructure",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"34. The Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) was introduced in 1996-97 and was allotted large funds year after year. Yet, out of 178 large and medium irrigation projects that were identified, only 28 have been completed. The programme is being restructured. Truly last mile projects that can be completed by March 2005 will be given overriding priority, and other projects that can be completed by March 2006 will also be taken up in the current year. Next year we shall move the goal-post to March 2007, the year after to March 2008, and so on. I have provided a sum of Rs.2800 crore to the AIBP this year.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"35. The Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) was established in NABARD in 1994-95. Five months ago, a decision was taken to close the RIDF and establish, in its place, another Fund with slightly different objectives. Many State Governments and many honourable Members have opposed the closure of RIDF. In deference to their wishes, and in tune with my own thinking, I have decided to revive the RIDF. RIDF’s guidelines have been revised, and a corpus of Rs.8000 crore will be provided for RIDF during 2004-05.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,Restoring water bodies,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"36. I now turn to one of my big dreams. Water is the lifeline of civilization. We have been warned that the biggest crisis that the world will face in the 21st century will be the crisis of water. Water is indeed a renewable resource but, in any given year, it is not inexhaustible. The crisis of water has affected the lives of millions of our fellow citizens. In some cities, whole households keep awake to receive one or two buckets of water well past midnight. In rural areas, the girl child is often pulled out of school in order to fetch water. I am deeply concerned about the impending crisis. I therefore propose an ambitious scheme. Through the ages, Indian agriculture has been sustained by natural and man-made water bodies such as lakes, tanks, ponds and similar structures. It has been estimated that there are more than a million such structures and about 500,000 are used for irrigation. Many of them have fallen into disuse. Many of them have accumulated silt. Many require urgent repairs.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"37. I therefore propose to launch a massive scheme to repair, renovate and restore all the water bodies that are directly linked to agriculture. In the current year, we shall begin with pilot projects in at least five districts, and we shall select at least one district in each of the five regions of the country. The estimated cost is Rs.100 crore. Funds for the five pilot projects will be drawn from existing programmes such as SGRY, PMGJSY, DPAP, DDP and IWDP. Once the pilot projects are completed and validated, Government will launch the National Water Resources Development Project and complete it over a period of 7 to 10 years.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"38. Funds will not be a constraint for implementing the Project. For instance, Life Insurance Corporation of India invests, on an average, Rs.3000 crore per year in water-related programmes. I also intend to pose this Project to multilateral agencies for funding. It is my hope that by the beginning of the next decade all water bodies in India will be restored to their original glory and that the storage capacity of these water bodies will be augmented by at least 100 per cent.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,Water harvesting,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"39. Water harvesting schemes, specific to an area or village, have been found to be extremely useful. Such schemes are supported by a number of credit institutions. However, farmers belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes rarely benefit from such schemes. In order to help these farmers, Government will launch a nationwide water harvesting scheme. The scheme will cover one lakh irrigation units at an average cost of Rs.20,000 per unit. NABARD will lend the money on easy terms and no margin money will be charged from the borrower. Government will provide a 50 per cent capital subsidy through NABARD, and the estimate for the scheme is Rs.100 crore.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,Flood control,,,,,

The time has come to encourage our farmers to diversify into areas such as horticulture, floriculture and oilseeds. The Anand model has been a great success in milk and milk products. Government proposes to launch a National Horticulture Mission. The goal is to double horticulture production from the current level of 150 million tonnes to 300 million tonnes by 2011-12. I invite States to join hands with the Government in launching this mission. One of the steps that States will be encouraged to take is to emulate the Anand model and establish a State Level Cooperative Society for promoting horticulture.",,,,,

The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is a beneficiary of the scheme under which every commercial rupee earned by ICAR, incrementally, is matched by another rupee from the Budget. Besides, ICAR receives funds from the Technology Development Board in respect of projects that are commercially viable. Agricultural research must be expanded rapidly to new frontiers such as bio-technology, vaccines and diagnostics. There must be a special focus on farming in drylands and unirrigated areas. The allocation for 2004-05 is Rs.1000 crore (which is an increase from Rs.775 crore in BE 2003-04), and I propose to make further allocations during the course of the year.",,,,,

In my view, SFAC should provide venture capital to projects and must be run, preferably by a banker, on purely business lines. The MS Swaminathan Research Foundation has identified 13 districts where there is a huge potential for agri-businesses and an appetite for investment of nearly Rs.170 crore. The Ministry of Agriculture has initiated action to improve the governance of SFAC, including the appointment of a banker as the chief executive.

The National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS) which insures the yield or crop is in operation since Rabi 1999-2000. AIC is redesigning the scheme. We shall continue with the scheme and make another evaluation. Meanwhile, a pilot scheme insuring farm income (as opposed to crop) has been launched in 19 districts across 12 States during Rabi 2003-04. Government has decided to extend the scheme to Kharif 2004 in order to assess its feasibility. I wish to add that a weather insurance scheme appears to be more promising, at least in the design. AIC is introducing the scheme on a trial basis in 20 rain gauge stations in the current crop season. It is difficult to tell at this stage which of the three schemes will be successful. Agricultural insurance as well as livestock insurance are complex products and have to be designed with care.

Built into IAY is a credit-cum-subsidy scheme for rural households. A subsidy upto Rs.10,000 and loan upto Rs.40,000 are provided to eligible households. The allocation for IAY in BE 2003-04 was Rs.1710 crore. In the current year, I propose to raise the allocation to Rs.2247 crore and, if more money is needed, it will be found within the enhanced Plan outlay.",,,,,

2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"56. In order to complement IAY, the Golden Jubilee Rural Housing Finance Scheme was launched in August 1997 to give a boost to rural housing. The response has been encouraging, and 10.26 lakh dwelling units have been financed so far. However, the number appears to have stagnated at about 180,000 per year in the last three years. The scheme deserves a further stimulus. I am happy to announce that the National Housing Bank has offered to reduce the rate of refinance by 25 basis points this year. RBI has agreed to revise the norms of re-payment for rural housing loans by banks, so that the instalments coincide with crop cycles. A major impediment to credit for rural housing is absence of proper title to the land. The Government of West Bengal has made a law to simplify the creation of security. It appears to me that the law deserves to be emulated by other States. With these changes, I believe it is possible to set a higher target of 250,000 rural housing units per year.",,,,,

The Commission will have the broad authority of the Government to engage, discuss with and invite domestic and foreign businesses to invest in India. It will be chaired by an eminent person. The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) has played a useful role, and even now it serves as a one-stop centre for securing the nod of different ministries and departments to a proposed investment. Government believes that many of the functions of FIPB could be put on the automatic route, and leave FIPB as a one-stop service centre and facilitator. The function of wooing domestic and foreign investors will be performed by the proposed Investment Commission.",,,,,

In order to extract value for its holding and to compensate the effect of dilution, Government intends to piggy-back on the public issue of NTPC and disinvest approximately five per cent of its holding. This and some other cases which are under examination are expected to yield a sum of Rs.4000 crore in the current year. While the disinvestment revenues will be part of the Consolidated Fund of India, I shall, while presenting the Budget for 2005-06, report to the House the manner in which the said revenues have been or will be applied for specified social sector schemes.",,,,,

Keeping in mind the twin objectives, the Ministry of Small Scale Industry has identified 85 items that can be safely taken out of the reserved list. Furthermore, it is felt that technology upgradation of SSI units is the most urgent requirement to do business in a competitive environment. I have reviewed the Capital Subsidy Scheme, and I propose to raise the ceiling for loans under the scheme from Rs.40 lakh to Rs.1 crore. The rate of subsidy will also be raised from 12 per cent to 15 per cent. The scope of the scheme will be enlarged by adding more sub-sectors and technologies eligible for assistance. SSI units will be encouraged to obtain credit rating. With these measures, I expect that many more SSI units will benefit from the restructured scheme.

The country needs a modern and efficient trade tax system that incorporates the international best practices. At the June 18, 2004 meeting of the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers, to which all Finance Ministers were invited, and chaired by my distinguished friend Dr. Asim Das Gupta, there was a broad consensus among the States to implement VAT. April 1, 2005 has been set as the date for implementation. I welcome the decision and warmly congratulate the State Governments. I urge all States that have not yet passed the relevant VAT legislation to do so before the end of 2004. International experience, as well as the experience of the State of Haryana, suggests that VAT will lead to an increase in revenue and not a loss in revenue. Nevertheless, in order to give comfort to the States, I propose to evolve a formula for determining the compensation for the loss of revenue, if any. I have offered the States the services of a Technical Experts Committee. The Committee will work with the States closely, and help them move steadily towards the stage of implementation.",,,,,

The States were also able to borrow at lower rates and swap old high cost loans. Since 2002, States have benefited to the extent of nearly Rs.2500 crore through the debt swap scheme. While borrowers are benefited by moderate interest rates, there is a need to boost savings and to protect the savers. I am convinced that, in the larger interests of the country, we should maintain a benign interest rate regime that appropriately balances the legitimate claims of the savers and borrowers.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"74. I believe that all interest rates should be aligned to the market, save for one or two exceptions. There is a need for a savings instrument that will give a return to senior citizens which is above the market-determined rate. There is also a need for an instrument that will provide a risk-free avenue for all citizens to save for a longer term, and such an instrument should bear a slightly higher rate of interest. Balancing these considerations, I do not propose to make any change in the existing rates of interest on small savings instruments. Consequently, PPF, GPF and the Special Deposit Scheme will attract 8 per cent interest this year. For senior citizens, I propose to introduce a new scheme called the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme offering an interest rate of 9 per cent per annum. For all other citizens, I propose to continue the Government Savings bond which will carry an interest rate of 8 per cent per annum. The Varishta Pension Bima Yojana may no longer be necessary since the new savings scheme will cover the senior citizens adequately.",,,,,

We are helping the States in other ways too. One of them is the Debt Swap Scheme. I propose to extend the facility of debt swap by allowing States to raise fresh loans and repay their old high-cost loans to NABARD and some other agencies. I also propose to consult the States on allowing them to increase their open market borrowings and reduce their dependence on loans from the Central Government. I shall also consider passing on external loans to the States on a back-to-back basis.",,,,,

Bihar, for example, has a number of projects pending for a long time, including projects in power, roads, drainage and rehabilitation of displaced persons. I would like to assure the House that Bihar will be assisted through the Rashtriya Sam Vikas Yojana.

Accordingly, all Ministries and Departments have been mandated to allocate at least 10 per cent of their Plan budget for schemes and programmes in the NER. This amounts to an allocation of Rs.5823 crore to be spent in the NER. The amount remaining unspent from this 10 per cent allocation is transferred to a non-lapsable Central pool of resources for development of the NER. In the current year, Rs.650 crore have been provided from the Central pool of resources for specific projects and schemes in this region, up from Rs.550 crore in 2003-04.",,,,,

It is expected that this will enable taking up social and physical infrastructure programmes in the poorest and most backward districts in the country within a given time frame. The Fund will become operational from the financial year 2005-06. Further details will be worked out in consultation with the Planning Commission.",,,,,

The number, the variety and even the acronyms under which these schemes are known are mind-boggling. I also found that there are many schemes with more or less the same objectives. In some cases, all the schemes were located in one ministry or department; in other cases, they were distributed among different ministries or departments. Plan schemes can be broadly divided into three categories – Central Sector, State Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes. The NCMP requires that all Centrally Sponsored Schemes, except national priority areas like family planning, shall be transferred to the States. Fortunately, a new Planning Commission is in place, and I am confident that the Planning Commission will bring some order into the tangled web of schemes.",,,,,

I estimate total revenue receipts of the Central Government at Rs.309,322 crore and the revenue expenditure at Rs.385,493 crore. Consequently, the revenue deficit is estimated at Rs.76,171 crore equivalent to 2.5 per cent of GDP, which is one percentage point below the corresponding estimate of 3.5 per cent of GDP in 2003-04 (according to the provisional actuals). The fiscal deficit is estimated at Rs.137,407 crore, which is 4.4 per cent of the estimated GDP.",,,,,

2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,92. I shall now deal with my tax proposals.,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"93. Taxation is a key tool of fiscal policy. The NCMP has promised that ""tax rates will be stable and conducive to growth, compliance and investment"". Thanks to policies initiated in the 1990s, direct tax rates are now moderate and require only fine tuning from time to time. Indirect taxes have also been moderated through a calibrated reduction in customs and excise duties. The proportion of direct tax revenues to GDP has increased from 1.9 per cent in 1990-91 to 3.8 per cent in 2003-04. As expected, the proportion of indirect tax revenues to GDP has declined from 7.9 per cent in 1990-91, but the decline has been rather sharp with the proportion at 5.3 per cent in 2003-04. The weak spot is central excise. Excise revenues are stuck, rather stubbornly, at around 3.3 per cent of GDP. While reduction in excise duty rates partly accounts for this situation, the expansion of the manufacturing industry ought to have given us larger revenues.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"94. Through my policies on taxation, I wish to signal that we remain committed to moderation and stability in tax rates; that we remain committed to increasing revenues from direct taxes and excise duties; and that we remain committed to expanding the service tax net because the services sector accounts for 51 per cent of GDP. I shall also use tax policies to provide incentives to certain kinds of investment and to influence certain kinds of behaviour in the market.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"95. I am a votary of tax reforms but it would be unwise on my part to attempt to do tax reform in a hurried or piece-meal manner. Seven months from now there will be another Budget, and there will be an occasion to visit the subject of tax reform.",,,,,

2004-05,P. Chidambaram,Direct taxes,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"96. I shall begin with my direct tax proposals. Let me give you the good news first. No one with a taxable income of Rs.100,000 will be required to pay any income tax any more. It was not easy to reach this decision. While the tax rates are moderate, it is the tax slabs which cause concern. However, I am unable to alter the tax slabs because I cannot afford to lose a large amount of revenue at a time when the Government has assumed a larger responsibility for investment and welfare programmes. Out of nearly 3.4 crore persons filing income tax returns, only 2.7 crore assessees are taxpayers. My proposal will give relief to 1.4 crore assessees. The method that I have adopted is somewhat novel. While everyone will file his return according to the current tax slabs and tax rates, and compute his taxable income and the tax payable, any one with a taxable income of Rs.100,000 will have his income tax liability automatically rebated. I cannot give more relief, or relief across the Board, in this Budget. If compliance improves, I promise to revisit the subject.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"97. I propose to give relief to certain sections of deserving tax payers. Accordingly, I propose to exempt from income tax the family pension received by widows, children and nominated heirs of members of the armed forces and the paramilitary forces killed in the course of operational duties. This is my humble salute to their supreme sacrifice.",,,,,

2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"99. Farmers have brought to my notice that agricultural land situated in certain urban agglomerations fall under the definition of capital asset and the compensation for acquisition of such land is subjected to capital gains tax. Such compensation deserves to be exempted from capital gains tax. I propose to do so in cases where the compensation or the enhanced compensation has been received on or after April 1, 2004.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"100. A new ‘defined contribution’ pension scheme for new entrants into Central Government service has come into effect from January 1, 2004. The tax treatment of contributions made to the scheme has engaged the attention of Government. I propose to adopt the universally accepted formula of EET: that is, the contributions will be excluded from income for tax purposes; the accruals will also be exempt from tax; and only the terminal benefits will be taxed at the applicable rate in the year of receipt.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"101. I propose to withdraw a few exemptions which have outlived their utility. Interest earned from a Non-Resident (External) Account and interest paid by banks to a Non-Resident or to a Not-Ordinarily Resident on deposits in foreign currency will not be exempt from tax. Similarly, any payment made by an Indian company to acquire an aircraft or an aircraft engine on lease from a foreign state or a foreign enterprise will not be exempt from tax. These exemptions will cease prospectively from September 1, 2004.",,,,,

Hence, I propose to continue with the additional depreciation of 15 per cent allowed under Section 32(1)(iia) on new plant and machinery acquired or installed in an existing undertaking; however, the required increase in installed capacity will now be 10 per cent, and not 25 per cent.",,,,,

2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"106. The power sector also deserves tax concessions. The Electricity Act 2003 envisages unbundling of generation, transmission and distribution. In order to promote renovation and modernization of existing transmission and distribution lines, I propose to extend the benefit under Section 80 IA to projects undertaken during the period April 1, 2004 to March 31, 2006.",,,,,

2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"107. The shipping industry has demanded the levy of a tonnage tax to make it intentionally competitive. Tonnage tax will also induce more ships to fly the Indian flag. I propose to accept the request. Consequently, the concessional regime under Section 33 AC will be withdrawn and shipping companies will now have only an option to pay the tonnage tax or normal corporate tax on profits.",,,,,

I, therefore, propose to relax the condition of minimum plot size of one acre in the case of housing projects, as long as the projects are implemented in accordance with a scheme for reconstruction or development approved by the Central or State Government.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"111. Capital gains tax is another vexed issue. When applied to capital market transactions, the issue becomes more complex. Questions have been raised about the definitions of long-term and short-term, and the differential tax treatment meted to the two kinds of gains. There are no easy answers, but I have decided to make a beginning by revamping taxes on securities transactions. Our founding fathers had wisely included entry 90 in the Union List in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. Taking a cue from that entry, I propose to abolish the tax on long-term capital gains from securities transactions altogether. Instead, I propose to levy a small tax on transactions in securities on stock exchanges. The rate will be 0.15 per cent of the value of security. Thus, a transaction involving securities valued at, say, Rs.100,000 will now bear a small tax of Rs.150. The tax will be levied on the buyer. In the case of short-term capital gains from securities, I propose to reduce the rate of tax to a flat rate of 10 per cent. My calculation shows that the new tax regime will be a win-win situation for all concerned.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"112. I propose to make a change in the tax on dividends distributed by mutual funds. Equity-oriented mutual funds will continue to be exempt from tax. Debt-oriented mutual funds are now required to withhold 12.5 per cent of the income distributed to unit holders. Individuals and HUF unit holders will continue to enjoy the benefit of this rate. However, in the case of corporate unit holders, I propose a rate of 20 per cent. I am sure corporates will understand, because I am doing no more than partially closing a window of arbitrage opportunity.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,

2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"119. Now, I turn to my indirect tax proposals. The policy signal that needs to be reiterated is that customs duties will be brought down in a measured way. It is my intention to align India’s tariff structure to those of ASEAN countries. Eventually, there should be a uniform rate of tax on goods and services. During the last four years, my predecessors had adjusted excise duties and moved them towards a Central VAT rate. That process must continue. The most important goods in the manufacturing sector must therefore bear an excise duty of 16 per cent.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"120. Another principle that requires to be emphasized is that where an excise duty is levied, subject to only a few exceptions, like goods when imported should attract an equivalent countervailing duty (CVD). In my tax proposals, I have, therefore, removed the exemption from CVD enjoyed by some imported goods where there is no corresponding exemption from excise duty on Indian made goods.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"121. I may also point out that customs tariffs and excise duties are inter-related. While considering the tax regime for any sector, one must look at both customs duties and excise duties applicable to that sector.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,122. The peak rate of customs duty was reduced to 20 per cent in January 2004. I propose to maintain the peak rate for the rest of the current fiscal year.,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"123. I shall now deal with specific sectors beginning with metals, minerals and industrial raw materials. Steel is the leading metal. Normally, it should bear an excise duty of 16 per cent. However, in February this year, excise duty on steel was reduced from 16 per cent to 8 per cent, but with the caveat that the decision will be reviewed when the regular budget is presented. Belying expectations, steel prices have not moderated but have risen sharply. I propose to reduce the customs duty on non-alloy steel from 15 per cent to 10 per cent and to increase the excise duty on steel from 8 per cent to 12 per cent so that the countervailing duty will also be applicable to imports. I hope to recoup some of the revenue losses since February 2004.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"124. Alloy steel, copper, lead, zinc and base metals are basic raw materials used in a variety of industries. I propose to reduce the peak rate on such metals to 15 per cent. I also propose to reduce the customs duties on refractory raw minerals and mineral products like graphite, asbestos, mica and gypsum to 15 per cent. The customs duty on all catalysts will also be 15 per cent.",,,,,

2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"129. I propose to give some concessions to the health sector. A number of items for the disabled are already exempt from import duties or attract a concessional duty of 5 per cent. I propose that rehabilitation aids such as talking books, braille computer terminals, braille writers and typewriters, assistive listening devices, cochlear implants and stair lifts be fully exempt from customs duty. They will also be exempt from excise duty and CVD. Crutches, wheel chairs, walking frames, artificial limbs, etc. for the disabled will also be fully exempt from customs duty. There are some restrictions on institutions for the visually-impaired and the hearing-impaired availing of import duty exemptions. I propose to remove these restrictions as well as enlarge the list of exempted appliances. Ambulances used by government and municipal hospitals alone have been allowed the concessional excise duty of 16 per cent. I propose that all ambulances registered as such will be entitled to this benefit. Diagnostic kits for detecting hepatitis B alone are exempt from excise duty.

Last year, handlooms and powerlooms were brought into what is described as the Cenvat chain. The intention was good but, I am afraid, the decision did not take into account the decentralized and fragmented nature of production of fabrics in the country. Besides, the",,,,,

Meanwhile, there must be a level playing field.",,,,,

2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"143. If I have understood correctly the mind of Hon’ble Members of Parliament, and of the leaders of various political parties, I believe that there is a universal demand to free the handloom and powerloom sectors from the Cenvat regime. After giving my anxious consideration to the complex issues, I propose to withdraw the mandatory Cenvat duty. Instead, I propose to introduce a new tax regime for the textile sector and, in this exercise, I am happy to say that I have the full support of the Minister of Textiles.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,144. Let me now explain briefly the new regime.,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,

2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"• Secondly, there will be no mandatory excise duty on pure cotton, wool and silk, whether it is fibre, yarn, fabric or garment.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"• Thirdly, blended textiles and pure non-cotton (polyester, viscose, acrylic and nylon) will have a different tax regime.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"• Fourthly, there will be a mandatory excise duty on man-made staple fibre at 16 per cent; on polyester filament yarn (including textured yarn) at 24 per cent; and on other man-made filament yarn (including textured yarn) at 16 per cent.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"145. Every manufacturer – be it handloom or powerloom or composite mill – will have the option to choose between two routes. One will be the exemption route and the other will be the Cenvat route. Under the exemption route, no excise duty will be payable at any stage (except on man-made fibre and filament yarn). Under the Cenvat route, credit can be taken for all excise duties paid at earlier stages. For the purposes of the optional Cenvat route, it is necessary to specify in the Tariff schedule the applicable excise duty rates. For the pure cotton sector, the uniform rate will be 4 per cent on yarn, fabrics, garments and made-ups. For the blended textiles sector and pure non-cotton sector, the uniform rate will be 8 per cent.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"146. It is my firm belief that the millions of handloom weavers and powerloom weavers will welcome the new regime. As far as the composite mills are concerned, there is no cause for worry. They are also free to take the exemption route, but if they choose to opt for the Cenvat route, they may do so and claim Cenvat credit for all duties paid at earlier stages. Garment exporters should give the new regime a fair chance. I expect that prices of fabrics will moderate and garment exporters will stand to benefit. Their concerns, if any, can be addressed through the drawback or DEPB mechanism.",,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"147. In course of time, it is possible that some manufacturers of handlooms and powerlooms will take advantage of the low uniform rates of duty and opt for the Cenvat route.",,,,,

2004-05,P. Chidambaram,"148. There remains the service tax. I propose to take a major step towards integrating the tax on goods and services. Accordingly, I propose to extend credit of service tax and excise duty across goods and services. In order to neutralize the revenue impact of such extension, and keeping in mind the mean Cenvat rate, I propose to enhance the rate of service tax from 8 per cent to 10 per cent.",,,,,

2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"5.In May 2004, the UPA Government inherited an economy that had, as we now know, registered a growth rate of 8.5 per cent in 2003-04 on the back of a poor 4 per cent in the previous year.While growth was indeed broad-based, the impressive growth rate was due largely to the restoration of output in the agriculture and allied sector.I had then commented that my immediate predecessor was a very lucky man, even while his predecessor was not!Notwithstanding the high growth rate, there were several disturbing trends which came to notice in May 2004.The first was the liquidity overhang at the end of 2003-04 which had spilled over into 2004-05. The second was the definite buildup of inflationary pressures as a result of a sharp rise in global petroleum prices.The third was an unanticipated 13 per cent deficiency in the south-west monsoon.The fourth was an apparent decline in business confidence that had led to a sharp downturn in new investment, and also showed up as current account surpluses.By any standard, these were formidable challenges, but the UPA Government was prepared to face these challenges.",,,,,

2005-06,P. Chidambaram,The Present: Where We Are in 2004-05,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"6.The National Common Minimum Programme (NCMP) mandated the Government to maintain a growth rate of 7 - 8 per cent a year, to promote investment, to generate employment, to accelerate fiscal consolidation, to ensure a higher fiscal devolution, and to focus on agriculture, manufacturing and infrastructure.The NCMP also mandated the Government to provide universal access to education and health care and to assure one hundred days of employment to one person in each family.I believe that, in the space of 9 months, we have risen to the challenge and carved out many successes. ",,,,,

On a like-to-like basis, GBS for the Plan in 2005-06, works out to Rs.172,500 crore.This represents an increase of 16.9 per cent.Support for the Central Plan in BE 2004-05 was Rs.87,886 crore and in BE 2005-06 this has been enhanced to Rs.110,385 crore, representing a very substantial increase of 25.6 per cent.On priority sectors and flagship programmes falling under the NCMP, I propose to provide an additionalsum of Rs.25,000 crore in the next year.",,,,,

Other indicators of poverty are illiteracy, disease, infant mortality, malnutrition, absence of skills and unemployment.

2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"12. In the last Budget, I had rejected the idea of jobless growth.As I unfold the vision of the UPA Government, Hon’ble Members will note that the central theme that runs through the various schemes and programmes is creation of jobs. Assured irrigation facilities to an additional 1 crore hectares of land over a period of five years will generate employment for an additional 1 crore people at the rate 1 person per hectare.The food processing industry is growing at a rate which generates 2.5 lakh jobs every year.The textile sector alone has the potential to create 1.2 crore jobs over the next 5 years. The information technology (IT) industry is expected to offer an additional 70 lakh jobs by 2009. Construction industry is also expected to throw up lakhs of jobs.Sectors with potential for generating employment will receive the highest attention of the Government. ",,,,,

The key to empowering the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes is to provide top class education opportunities to meritorious students.The three on-going scholarship schemes for SC/ST students under the Central Plan –pre-Matric, post-Matric, and merit-based – will continue. To provide an added incentive, I propose a new window:a short list of institutes of excellence will be notified, and any SC/ST student who secures admission in one of those institutes will be awarded a larger scholarship that will meet the requirements for tuition fees, living expenses, books and a computer.The details of the scheme will be announced by the ministry concerned.",,,,,

India has also the potential to become an attractive destination for outsourcing in drug discovery and clinical research, and for co-development of drugs and manufacturing.

When large infrastructure projects are implemented, the foreign exchange resources could be drawn for financing necessary imports.Accordingly, I propose to establish an SPV to finance infrastructure projects in specified sectors. Roads, ports, airports and tourism would be sectors that can benefit most from the SPV.The projects will be appraised by an Inter-Institutional Group of banks and financial institutions.The SPV will lend funds, especially debt of longer term maturity, directly to the eligible projects to supplement other loans from banks and financial institutionsGovernment will communicate the borrowing limit to the SPV at the beginning of each fiscal year.For 2005-06, I propose to fix the borrowing limit at Rs.10,000 crore.",,,,,

2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"106.Non-Plan expenditure in 2005-06 is estimated to be Rs.370,847 crore, the increase being mainly due to enhanced grants to the States as recommended by TFC.",,,,,

2005-06,P. Chidambaram,Revenue Deficit and Fiscal Deficit,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"107.Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the Budget Estimates for 2005-06, the total expenditure is estimated at Rs.514,344 crore.I estimate total revenue receipts of the Central Government at Rs.351,200 crore and the revenue expenditure at Rs.446,512 crore.Consequently, the revenue deficit is estimated at Rs.95,312 crore which is equal to 2.7 per cent of the estimated GDP.The fiscal deficit is estimated at Rs.151,144 crore, which is 4.3 per cent of the estimated GDP. ",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"108.Consequent to accepting the recommendations of the Twelfth Finance Commission and the drastically changed pattern of devolution and funding, there has been a considerable strain in making the Budget for 2005-06.I was left with no option but to press the ‘pause’ button vis-a-vis the FRBM Act.I am relieved that we have not been forced to go in the opposite direction. I may add that we are perilously close to the limits of fiscal prudence and there is no more room for spending beyond our means.I am confident that we can resume the process of fiscal correction with effect from 2006-07 and achieve the FRBM goals by 2008-09.",,,,,

2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"109.Mr. Speaker, Sir, I shall now present my tax proposals.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"110.I had articulated the UPA Government’s principles and our approach to taxation in my Budget speech in July 2004, and, hence, there is no need to repeat them.While adhering to those principles, it is Government’s intention, as announced by the Prime Minister, to undertake major tax reforms to improve the tax to GDP ratio, expand the tax payer base, increase tax compliance and make tax administration more efficient. ",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,Indirect Taxes,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"111.I shall begin with my proposals on indirect taxes.First, customs duties.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"112.I intend to advance the Government’s declared policy of making the customs duty structure closer to that of our East Asian neighbours.Therefore, I propose to reduce the peak rate for non-agricultural products from 20 per cent to 15 per cent.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"113.Consistent with the peak duty rate,Ipropose to bring down the customs duty rates on capital goods and raw materials as well as correct any inverted duty structures.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"114.In order to promote investment, I propose to reduce the customs duties on selected capital goods and parts thereof to below 15 per cent, to 10 per cent in some cases and to 5 per cent in some others. ",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"115.For most textile machinery, I propose to reduce the duty from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, in order to help the textile industry acquire a competitive edge in the post-quota regime.Similarly, to encourage the food processing industry, I propose to reduce the duty on refrigerated vans from 20 per cent to 10 per cent.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"116.To give a leg-up to the leather and footwear industry, I propose to reduce the customs duties on seven specified machinery from 20 per cent to 5 per cent.The duty on ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA), an input for the footwear industry, is also proposed to be reduced from 20 per cent to 10 per cent.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,117.Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology are sunrise sectors. I propose to reduce the customs duty on nine specified machinery used in these two sectors to 5 per cent.,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,118.I also propose to reduce the customs duties on specified parts of battery-operated road vehicles and for printing presses from 20 per cent to 10 per cent.,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"119.For primary and secondary metals, I propose to reduce the customs duties from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. Similarly, industrial raw materials such as catalysts, refractory raw materials, basic plastic materials, molasses and industrial ethyl alcohol, which are key inputs to manufacture, willnow be liable to a reduced customs duty rate of 10 per cent.On lead, I propose to reduce the duty to 5 per cent.",,,,,

2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"122.The electronics and telecom sectors merit special attention.On 217 Information Technology Agreement (ITA) bound items, the duty is required to be brought down to nil.Consequently, to provide a level-playing field to the domestic industry, I propose to remove the customs duty on specified capital goods and all inputs required for the manufacture of ITA bound items.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"123.However, I intend to take the power to impose a countervailing duty (CVD) of 4 per cent on all imports to compensate for the State level taxes, in particular the forthcoming State level VAT that is proposed to be imposed on corresponding domestic goods.For the present, I propose to levy a CVD of 4 per cent only on the imports of ITA bound items and their inputs that attract nil duty.Credit for the CVD will be available against payment of excise duty.However, because we have a soft corner for these wares, IT software will be exempt from the proposed CVD.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"124.I do not propose to make any changes in the customs duties applicable to agricultural goods.In fact, I have decided to increase the duty on cut flowers from 30 per cent to 60 per cent.However, at the request of the trade, and since there is little domestic production, I propose to reduce the duty rate on cloves to 35 per cent. ",,,,,

2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"125.In order to encourage the import of technology to produce pure drinking water, I propose to reduce the import duty on atmospheric drinking water generators from 20 per cent to 5 per cent.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"126.I have some proposals on the Excise side too.Government’s intention is to bring as many goods as possible to the CENVAT rate of 16 per cent.Today, 5 items attract 24 per cent.Out of the 5, I have picked out three — polyester filament yarn, tyres and air conditioners — and I propose to reduce the excise duty on these goods to 16 per cent.Manufacturers of motor cars and aerated drinks, the other two items, would have to wait for some more time.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"127.Last year, I took a big step forward to prepare the textile industry to meet the challenges of the post-quota regime. I re-affirm that the CENVAT exemption route for natural fibres will remain in force.I now propose to give independent texturizers the option to avail of the exemption route or pay 8 per cent excise duty with CENVAT credit.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"128.Imitation jewellery now attracts an excise duty of 16 per cent.Since they are products predominantly consumed by the less affluent sections, I propose to reduce the excise duty to 8 per cent.At the same time, expensive and premium jewellery is now manufactured and sold under alluring brand names.On such branded jewellery, I propose to levy an excise duty of 2 per cent.I may clarify that there is no levy on unbranded jewellery, including unbranded gold jewellery.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"129.In order to remove certain distortions in the tax treatment of comparable products, I propose to levy an excise duty on mosaic tiles at 8 per cent and on road tractors for semi-trailers of engine capacity exceeding 1800 cc at 16 per cent. I may clarify that agricultural tractors will continue to remain exempt. ",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"130.Some sectors deserve relief, since they produce goods for the common citizen.Today, there is a surcharge of Re.1 per kg on tea.I propose to abolish the surcharge.There is also an excise duty of Re.1 per kg on refined edible oils and Rs.1.25 per kg on vanaspati.I propose to abolish both levies and fully exempt the two items.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"131.Even while protecting the handmade sector that makes matches, it is necessary to give some relief to the mechanized and semi-mechanized sectors.Hence, I propose to reduce the excise duty from 16 per cent to 12 per cent on matches made by these two sectors. Hand-made matches are fully exempt from excise duty and, therefore, will continue to enjoy adequate protection.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"132.I would like to provide some tax relief to the small scale industry (SSI).Hence, I propose to raise the ceiling for SSI exemption based on turnover from the level of Rs.3 crore per year to Rs.4 crore per year.Further, SSI units will now have only two options: either full exemption on the first clearance of Rs.1 crore or normal duty on the first clearance of Rs.1 crore with CENVAT credit.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,133.I propose to restore the excise duty rate on iron and steel to the normal level of 16 per cent.This should have little effect on prices because the entire duty is modvatable by most categories of consumers. ,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,134.I propose to increase the specific duty on molasses from Rs.500 per MT to Rs.1000 per MT to adjust partially for a hefty increase in molasses prices. I also propose to increase the specific duty on cement clinkers from Rs.250 per MT to Rs.350 per MT as an anti-avoidance measure.,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"135.The National Highways Development Project requires very large resources. In order to raise additional resources, I propose to increase the cess on petrol and diesel by 50 paise per litre.The additional resources will be earmarked exclusively for the national highways, and a suitable amendment is being proposed to the Central Road Fund Act, 2000.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"136.The levy of an education cess has been widely applauded.The health sector demands similar treatment.What better way is there to fund health care than tax thosegoods which are health hazards?I, therefore, propose to raise some additional resources and allocate the proceeds to finance the National Rural Health Mission.Accordingly, I propose to increase the specific rate on cigarettes by about 10 per cent and impose a surcharge of 10 per cent on ad valorem duties on other tobacco products including gutka, chewing tobacco, snuff and pan masala. However, biris will not be subject to this levy.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"137.Finally, there is the issue of taxes on petroleum products.After examining the Lahiri committee’s report, I propose to make major changes in the customs and excise duty rates. The customs duty on crude petroleum will be reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"138.On LPG for domestic consumption and on subsidized kerosene, the customs duty will be nil.On both products, the excise duty will also be nil.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"139.On other petroleum products, including motor spirit (MS) and diesel (HSD), I propose to reduce the customs duty from the current level of 20 or 15 per cent to 10 per cent.I also propose to fix the excise duties on petrol and diesel as a combination of ad valorem and specific duties. ",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"140.The proposed changes are revenue neutral, and I have been assured that there will be no increase in the retail prices of these products as a result of the changes in the duty structure.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"141.Consequent upon the changes made in customs and excise duties, the drawback rates for exported goods will be reviewed and modifications, wherever necessary, will be notified by April 30, 2005. ",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"142.Hon’ble Members are aware that many goods are chargeable to excise duty on a value with reference to their maximum retail price (MRP), after allowing suitable abatement.The system of quantifying the abatement should be made transparent.There should also be a mechanism to review the rate of abatement to reflect changed circumstances.Hence, as a trade facilitation measure, I propose to set up an advisory committee to advise the Government on the extent of abatement for both excise duty and service tax.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,143.The other indirect tax is service tax.Since the services sector accounts for about 52 percent of the GDP it is necessary to cast the net wide.,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"144.Last July, I raised the rate of service tax to 10 per cent.I propose to maintain that rate. ",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"145.I also propose to grant relief to small service providers.Accordingly, I propose to exempt from service tax those service providers whose gross turnover does not exceed Rs.4 lakh per year.According to my calculation, 80 per cent of the present service tax payers will gain from the exemption.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"146.I propose to include some additional services in the service tax net. New services to be covered include pipeline transport of goods; site formation, demolition and like services; membership fees of clubs and associations; packaging and specialized mailing services; survey and map making services; dredging services in rivers and harbours; cleaning services for commercial buildings and similar premises; and construction of planned residential complexes, with more than 12 dwelling units, developed by builders.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"147.I also propose to expand the coverage of certain services, but I shall not burden you with the details.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,Direct Taxes,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,148.I shall now turn to my proposals on direct taxes.,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"149.Last July, as an interim measure, I made a provision under which a person with a taxable income of Rs.100,000 would not be required to pay any income tax.About 1.4 crore assessees got relief.I promised to revisit the subject in this Budget.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"150.As part of a major overhaul of direct taxes, I propose to alter the tax brackets after taking due note of the universal demand of Members of Parliament and the need to provide stability in the medium term. ",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"151.Accordingly, I propose that the new tax brackets and the new rates will be as follows:",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,Up to Rs.1 lakh .. nil,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,Rs.1 lakh to Rs.1.5 lakh.. 10 per cent,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,Rs.1.5 lakh to Rs.2.5 lakh.. 20 per cent,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,Above Rs.2.5 lakh.. 30 per cent,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"Further, the level at which the surcharge of 10 per cent will apply will be raised to Rs.10 lakh taxable income. Hon’ble members will be happy to note that tax payers in every tax bracket will gain from my proposal. ",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"152.Besides, I propose to fix the threshold exemption level for women at Rs.1.25 lakh and the exemption level for senior citizens at Rs.1.5 lakh. These revised exemption levels will be in lieu of the prevailing tax rebate provisions.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"153.Given the higher exemption limits and the scaling up of tax brackets, the need for a separate personal allowance does not exist. Therefore, in conformity with growing international practice, I propose to remove the standard deduction.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"154.There is now a plethora of exemptions, ostensibly intended to promote savings.Some exemptions are based on the principle of deduction from taxable income and some exemptions are based on the principle of tax rebate.I believe the time is ripe to clean up these exemptions.At the same time, it is necessary to encourage savings, and tax relief is a method to induce people to save.Further, I think that the State must be neutral between one form of saving and another, and allow the tax payer greater flexibility in making savings/investment decisions. ",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"155.For all these reasons, in addition to the basic exemption limits, I propose to allow every tax payer a consolidated limit of Rs.1 lakh for savings which will be deducted from the income before tax is calculated.All prevailing sectoral caps will be removed. The rebate under Section 88 is being eliminated and Section 80L is being omitted to reflect the new regime.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"156.In addition to the sum of Rs.1 lakh, the following six deductions will continue to receive the same tax treatment as prevails today:",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,i)interest paid on housing loan for self-occupied house property;,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,ii)medical insurance premia;,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,iii) specified expenditure on disabled dependant;,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,iv) expenses for medical treatment for self or dependant or member of a HUF;,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,v)deduction in respect of interest on loans for pursuing higher studies; and,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram, vi) deduction to a person with disability.,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"157.Tax treatment of savings is a complex issue but we can benefit from the best international practices in this regard.We have already introduced EET-based taxation in the defined contribution pension scheme applicable to newly recruited government servants.Before we fully migrate to the EET system for all kinds of savings, it is necessary to resolve a number of administrative issues.Hence, without making any change for the present, I propose to set up a committee of experts that will work out the road map for moving towards an EET system.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"158.Bowing to popular demand, I propose to continue the exemption from tax on interest earned on accounts maintained by Non Resident Indians.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"159.While the tax reliefs that I have given today should warm the hearts of the tax payers, I have also an obligation to raise resources, especially to meet the large requirements of NCMP-mandated programmes.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"160.I have looked into the present system of taxing perquisites and I have found that many perquisites are disguised as fringe benefits, and escape tax.Neither the employer nor the employee pays any tax on these benefits which are certainly of considerable material value. At present, where the benefits are fully attributable to the employee they are taxed in the hands of the employee; that position will continue. In addition, I now propose that where the benefits are usually enjoyed collectively by the employees and cannot be attributed to individual employees, they shall be taxed in the hands of the employer.However, transport services for workers and staff and canteen services in an office or factory will be outside the tax net. The tax is not a new tax, although I am obliged to call it by a new name, namely, Fringe Benefits Tax.The rate will be 30 per cent on an appropriately defined base.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"161.I believe I have given a large measure of relief to personal income tax payers,and I hope all sections of the people and all members of the House are happy.This leads me to corporate income tax. ",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"162.The corporate income tax rate, the surcharge thereon and the rates of depreciation are inter-linked.Any reform would have to address all three elements.The international best practice is to provide for depreciation at rates that would enable the investor to replace the asset before its economic life ends.In India, in addition to the depreciation rate we have allowed an initial depreciation in order to encourage new investment.Hon’ble members may recall that, last July, I reduced the condition relating to increase in installed capacity from 25 per cent to 10 per cent. ",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"163.I am also obliged to keep in mind that a number of profit making companies continue to pay low tax, even if well within the law, by taking advantage of liberal depreciation rates and of exemptions and incentives.Moreover, the current depreciation rates lean towards employing capital rather than labour.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,164.There is also a demand that corporate tax rates should be aligned with the highest marginal personal income tax rate.,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"165.After careful consideration of the pros and cons, the interest of the revenue and the need to give the corporate sector a measure of relief, I propose the following tax structure.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"166.For domestic companies, the corporate income tax rate will be 30 per cent.There will also be a surcharge of 10 percent.The rate of depreciation will be 15 per cent for general machinery and plant, but the initial depreciation rate will be increased to 20 per cent.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"167.The corporate sector will find that the proposed tax structure is fair, gives them relief of nearly 3 per cent in the tax rate, encourages new investment and ensures equity among all sections of corporate tax payers.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"168.As a further measure of relief, I propose to remove the requirement of 10 per cent increase in installed capacity for availing of the benefit of initial depreciation.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"169.To encourage technological upgradation, I propose to reduce the withholding tax on technical services from 20 per cent to 10 per cent.",,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,170.I also propose that credit will be allowed for the Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid under Section 115 JB of the Income Tax Act.,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,171.I do not propose to make any changes in the tax regime applicable to foreign companies.,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"172.Last July, I had indicated that I would review the terminal dates on exemptions given for specific purposes.Accordingly, I propose to extend the terminal date, in the following three cases, from March 31, 2005 to March 31, 2007:",,,,,

2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"174.The securities transaction tax (STT) has stabilized, but the rates are widely perceived to be too low.I, therefore, propose to make a very nominal increase in the rates for all categories of transactions.Thus, a day trader who is liable to pay STT at 0.015 per cent will now be liable to pay at 0.02 per cent. This small increase should not ruffle anyone’s feathers. This nominal rate of increase will apply to all categories. ",,,,,

I am concerned about large cash transactions, especially withdrawals of cash, when there is no ostensible purpose to withdraw such large amounts of cash. These cash withdrawals leave no trail, and presumably become part of the black economy.Therefore, I propose to introduce two anti tax-evasion measures:Firstly, I propose to levy a tax on withdrawal of cash on a single day of over Rs.10,000 or more from banks at the rate of 0.1 per cent.Thus, a person withdrawing Rs.10,000 in cash would have to pay a small sum of Rs.10.

2005-06,P. Chidambaram,"182.One of India’s proudest sons, Dr Amartya Sen, argues in his book “Development as Freedom” that development is a process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy. He says, “Growth of GNP or of individual incomes can, of course, be very important as means to expanding the freedoms enjoyed by the members of the society.But freedoms depend also on other determinants, such as social and economic arrangements (for example, facilities for education and health care) as well as political and civil rights.”The UPA Government accepts this ethical dimension to the discussion of economic issues, and in this Budget I have attempted to reflect that dimension.More or less the same idea was articulated two thousand years ago by Saint Tiruvalluvar who said: ",,,,,

2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Mr. Speaker, Sir.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,It is my privilege to present the Budget for the year 2006-07.,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,An Overview of the Economy,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Twenty months ago, when I presented the first Budget of the UPA Government, I asked Honourable Members—and the people of this country—to walk with us on the path of honour and courage. The final report card on the first year of the UPA Government is out and there are reasons to celebrate.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"According to the Central Statistical Organization (CSO), the growth rate in 2004-05 was 7.5 per cent, with the manufacturing sector growing at 8.1 per cent. More importantly, at current market prices, gross domestic saving increased to 29.1 per cent of GDP and the rate of gross capital formation increased to 30.1 per cent of GDP. I have no doubt in my mind that these results were due to the political message conveyed by the National Common Minimum Programme (NCMP); the perceptive leadership of the Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh; the policy changes made by the Government; and the palpable confidence of the Indian people that their future is in safe hands.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"I am happy to report that the prospects for 2005-06 are just as good, if not better. This year can be characterized as the best of times and the worst of times. Nature has not been kind to us. Natural calamities took a heavy toll on human lives besides causing extensive damage to crops, roads, houses and the infrastructure. Government provided immediate interim relief; this was followed by releases from the Calamity Relief Fund (CRF) and Natural Calamity Contingency Fund (NCCF) totalling Rs. 5,145.37 crore to date. Obviously, this assistance will not be enough. The Planning Commission will draw up a programme for rebuilding the damaged infrastructure and I wish to assure the House that the Government will provide the money for rehabilitation and reconstruction.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"It was also the best of times. Government has been able to fulfil the first NCMP obligation of ensuring a high growth rate. According to the CSO’s advance estimates, GDP growth is likely to be 8.1 per cent this year, with the manufacturing sector expected to grow at 9.4 per cent. Agricultural growth has bounced back to 2.3 per cent and, barring mining, all other sectors are performing satisfactorily. Inflation, as on 11 February 2006 was 4.02 per cent. Non-food credit is growing by over 25 per cent. A large part of the credit goes to our farmers, workers, service providers, traders and business persons, and I would urge the House to join me in saluting them.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"The assault on poverty and unemployment continues. I believe that growth is the best antidote to poverty. The GDP growth target for the Tenth Plan was set at 8 per cent. Thanks to three years of 7.5 per cent plus growth, it is possible that the overall growth rate will be 7 per cent. In recent speeches, the Prime Minister has raised the bar to 10 per cent, and the Government is determined to take the country to that high growth path. Growth will be our mount; equity will be our companion; and social justice will be our destination.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,Implementing the NCMP Mandate,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Our success this year is due to our unrelenting emphasis on fiscal prudence through enhanced revenues and expenditure control, monetary stability and management of the external debt. However, our success should not tempt us to stray from this path, and we shall not do so.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"One of the important NCMP obligations was to focus on agriculture: we have done so, and the output of foodgrains is expected to be",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"209.3 million ton, which is about 5 million ton more than in the previous year.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"The NCMP mandates the Government to promote employment: while creating permanent and quality jobs in the productive sectors, for providing immediate relief to the poor, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme was launched on 2 February 2006. In the current year, under a clutch of schemes including the Food for Work programme, a sum of Rs. 11,700 crore is expected to be spent on rural employment.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,The NCMP mandates the Government to enhance investment: the investment rate has increased steadily from 25.3 per cent in 2002-03 to 30.1 per cent in 2004-05. Several indicators point to continued buoyancy of capital formation in the economy.,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"The NCMP also mandates the Government to augment infrastructure. 5,083 MW of capacity will be added to power generation in 2005-06, and during the Tenth Plan period the total addition is estimated at 34,000 MW, which is a record. Until December 2005, under the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana, contracts have been placed for projects spanning 95 districts and covering 41,461 un-electrified and 9,379 electrified villages. Work is on at full steam on the Golden Quadrilateral (GQ) and the North-South, East-West Corridors. As against 1.86 kms per day completed prior to May 2004, the schemes are progressing at the rate of 4.48 kms per day. 96 per cent of the GQ will be completed by June 2006 and the Corridors will be completed by end 2008. There is also substantial and visible progress in improving our ports, airports and rural roads.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"As the year draws to a close, I look back with satisfaction that the promises we made to the common citizen—the aam admi—have been substantially redeemed.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,Bharat Nirman,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"I would like to make special mention of Bharat Nirman. It epitomizes the UPA’s approach to governance. It is a paradigm shift that will enable us to use the resources thrown up by the engine of growth for building infrastructure and bringing basic amenities to rural India. Honourable Members are aware of the six components of Bharat Nirman and the ambitious targets to be achieved by the year 2009. In the first year of its implementation, 2005-06:",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"•    Rs. 944.18 crore has been released so far as grant under the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) and the target of 6,00,000 hectares of irrigation potential is expected to be created this year.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"•    Against the physical target of 56,270 habitations, 47,546 habitations have been covered until January 2006 under the Accelerated Rural Water Supply Project (ARWSP).",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"•    5,337 habitations were connected under the rural roads programme by September 2005, and Rs. 3,749 crore has been released so far.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"•    8,70,000 rural houses have been constructed and a sum of Rs. 2,260 crore has been released till January 2006.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"•    The entire allocation for rural electrification of Rs. 1,100 crore has been released and the target of covering 10,366 villages is expected to be achieved in the current fiscal.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"•    17,182 villages have been provided with a telephone till December 2005 in the first year of the three year programme.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"These numbers are a complete answer to those who scoffed at Bharat Nirman. We are determined to soldier on, and execute the programme in the mission mode. Since the implementation of Bharat Nirman has gathered pace, I propose to extend larger budgetary support to the programme. Including the North East component, as against Rs. 12,160 crore provided in the current year, the corresponding budgetary provision will be Rs. 18,696 crore in 2006-07, an increase of 54 per cent.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,The Flagship Programmes,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Let me now present an overview of the Budget. Obviously, the bulk of the resources must go to the UPA Government’s eight flagship programmes: Sarva Siksha Abhiyan, Mid-day Meal Scheme, Rajiv Gandhi Drinking Water Mission, Total Sanitation Campaign, National Rural Health Mission, Integrated Child Development Services, National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"In 2005-06, Gross Budgetary Support (GBS) for the Plan was Rs. 1,43,497 crore. Of this, support to the Central Plan was Rs. 1,10,385 crore. I propose to increase both allocations substantially. GBS for 2006-07 has been fixed at Rs. 1,72,728 crore, representing an increase of 20.4 per cent. Out of this, the Central Plan will receive a support of Rs. 1,31,285 crore.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Education and health will continue to enjoy primacy. For 2006-07, the allocation for education has been enhanced by 31.5 per cent to Rs. 24,115 crore and for health and family welfare by 22 per cent to Rs. 12,546 crore.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"On the eight flagship programmes, the total allocation in 2005-06 was Rs. 34,927 crore. In the ensuing fiscal year, the total allocation will be Rs. 50,015 crore, representing an additionality of Rs. 15,088 crore or 43.2 per cent.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,North Eastern Region (NER),,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"To this, however, we must add the allocation of 10 per cent of the Plan Budget of each Ministry/Department for schemes and programmes in the North Eastern Region (NER). For the flagship programmes alone, this would amount to an additional allocation of Rs. 4,870 crore in 2006-07. The total budget allocation for the NER is Rs. 12,041 crore which includes Rs. 1,350 crore provided to the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (DONER). From BE 2005-06 to BE 2006-07, the step up is 18 per cent.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) has recorded remarkable progress in 2005-06 in terms of new schools, additional classrooms and additional teachers. Two independent surveys show that 93 per cent of the children in the age group 6-14 years are in school, and the number of children not in school has come down to about one crore. Recognizing good performance, I propose to increase the outlay for SSA from Rs. 7,156 crore to Rs. 10,041 crore in 2006-07. 5,00,000 additional classrooms will be constructed and 1,50,000 more teachers will be appointed.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"In 2006-07, we shall transfer Rs. 8,746 crore to the Prarambhik Siksha Kosh from the revenues raised through the education cess.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,Mid-day Meal Scheme,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"12 crore children are now covered under the Mid-day Meal Scheme, which is the largest school lunch programme in the world. I propose to enhance the allocation from Rs. 3,010 crore to Rs. 4,813 crore in 2006-07.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,Drinking Water and Sanitation,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"The target for the current year for drinking water supply will be completed, and 56,270 habitations and 1,40,000 schools will be covered. Apart from non-coverage, there is the persistent problem of slippage. The strategy to tackle both includes conservation, better operational management, and water quality monitoring and capacity building at the village level. The Government will provide non-recurring assistance of Rs. 213 crore in 2006-07 for setting up district-level water testing laboratories and field-level water testing kits. I propose to increase the provision for the Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission from Rs. 3,645 crore to Rs. 4,680 crore next year.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,I also propose to increase the provision for the Rural Sanitation Campaign from Rs. 630 crore to Rs. 720 crore in 2006-07.,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,National Rural Health Mission (NRHM),,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,The National Rural Health Mission was launched on 12 April 2005.,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"I am confident that in 2006-07 more than 2,00,000 Associated Social Health Activists (ASHA) will be fully functional and over 1,000 block level community health centres will provide round the clock services. I have increased the allocation for NRHM from Rs. 6,553 crore to Rs. 8,207 crore for the next year.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"The WHO standard defining ‘elimination of leprosy’ is one case per 10,000 population. I am happy to announce that the goal of eliminating leprosy was reached in December 2005. Continuing the vigorous immunization programme, we hope to eliminate polio too from the country by December 2007.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,Integrated Child Development Services,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"We have expanded the Integrated Child Development Services (lCDS) scheme and created an additional 1,88,168 centres. Supplementary nutrition is the most important component of the scheme. Beginning this year, the Centre is assisting the States to the extent of 50 per cent of the actual expenditure incurred for supplementary nutrition or 50 per cent of the cost norms, whichever is less. The cost to the Centre this year is estimated at Rs. 1,500 crore, and I propose to increase this assistance to Rs. 1,700 crore for 2006-07. The total allocation for ICDS is being increased from Rs. 3,315 crore to Rs. 4,087 crore.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"I have already referred to the Rural Employment Scheme which is the primary instrument to combat rural unemployment and hunger poverty. For 2006-07, the total allocation for rural employment will be Rs. 14,300 crore. Of this, Rs. 11,300 crore (including NER component) will be under the NREG Act and Rs. 3,000 crore (including NER component) will be under SGRY. Since there is a legal guarantee of employment under the NREG Act, more funds will be provided according to need.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission was launched on 3 December 2005. For the next year, against the estimated outlay of Rs. 6,250 crore, I propose to provide a grant of Rs. 4,595 crore. Apart from the four projects, including Mumbai metro rail and Bangalore metro rail, mentioned in my Budget speech last year, the projects under active consideration include projects in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Planned urbanization can act as a spur to growth, employment and a better quality of life. Government will actively promote the establishment of new towns, preferably focussed on a specific industry, for example Information Technology, or a specific theme, for example education or health. Some projects are on the anvil in West Bengal and Karnataka.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,National Social Assistance Programme,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Old age pensions are granted under the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) to destitute persons above the age of 65 years at Rs. 75 per month. This is woefully inadequate. I propose to increase the pension to Rs. 200 per month. I have provided Rs. 1,430 crore for 2006-07 and additional funds, if required, will be provided during the course of the year. I would urge State Governments to make an equal contribution from their resources so that a destitute pensioner would get at least Rs. 400 per month. I also propose to work with the Department of Posts and the banks to establish, within two years, a system under which the pension will be credited directly to the account of the beneficiary in a post office or a bank.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,Women and Children,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Last year, I introduced a statement highlighting the gender sensitivities of the budgetary allocations. I was able to cover 10 demands for grants. This time, I have been able to enlarge the statement on gender budgeting to include schemes where 100 per cent of the allocation is for the benefit of women as well as schemes where at least 30 per cent of the allocation is targeted towards women. The statement now covers 24 demands for grants in 18 Ministries/Departments and five Union Territories and schemes with an outlay of Rs. 28,737 crore.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Furthermore, several Ministries and Departments have initiated an exercise to prepare a public expenditure profile of their budgets from a gender perspective. 32 Ministries and Departments have set up Gender Budgeting Cells.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Government is committed to the welfare of Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs). Honourable Members will be happy to know that this Budget, like last year’s, contains a separate statement on the schemes for the welfare and development of SCs and STs. On a like to like basis, the allocations for schemes benefiting only SCs and STs have been enhanced by 14.5 per cent to Rs. 2,902 crore and the allocations for schemes with at least 20 per cent allocation for SCs and STs have been enhanced by 13.9 per cent to Rs. 9,690 crore.",,,,,

2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"The initial results of the Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya Scheme launched in 2004 are encouraging. 1,000 new residential schools for girls from SC, ST, OBC and minority communities will be opened in 2006-07. I have provided Rs. 128 crore, and I have agreed to provide an additional sum of Rs. 172 crore during the year. I propose to provide a further incentive to the girl child who passes the VIII Standard Examination and enrols in a secondary school. A sum of Rs. 3,000 will be deposited in her name, and she would be entitled to withdraw it on reaching 18 years of age.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Government has shifted the emphasis from sheer ‘quantity’ to the ‘quality’ of the outcome of the various social sector programmes. To ensure value for public expenditure, an Outcome Budget was presented on 25 August 2005. Government intends to present a Performance Budget on the first Outcome Budget before the end of the Budget Session. The Outcome Budget for 2006-07 will be placed before this House by 17 March 2006.

Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs) have, through internal and extra-budgetary resources, investment plans amounting to Rs. 1,22,757 crore in 2006-07. I am happy to announce that Government will provide equity support of Rs. 16,901 crore and loans of Rs. 2,789 crore to Central PSEs (including Railways).

Accordingly, an amount equal to two percentage points of the borrower’s interest liability on the principal amount up to Rs. 1,00,000, will be credited to his/her bank account before 31 March 2006.

Increasingly, scheduled commercial banks are also lending more to farmers. It is my intention to ensure that NABARD continues to provide refinance at an economical rate, so that the farmer ultimately gets the loan at a reasonable rate. Accordingly, after giving anxious consideration to market conditions, Government has decided to ensure that the farmer receives short-term credit at 7 per cent, with an upper limit of Rs. 3,00,000 on the principal amount. This would require a certain level of subvention to NABARD. I propose to give the subvention.

The Skills Development Initiative (SDI) announced last year has been taken up through a PPP scheme, and I propose to make an initial provision of Rs. 10 crore.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,Backward Regions Grant Fund,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Upon the establishment of a Backward Regions Grant Fund, a sum of Rs. 1,156 crore has been disbursed so far in the current year to the districts identified as backward as well as under Rashtriya Sam Vikas Yojana (RSVY). The Fund is being placed under the administrative control of the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, and I propose to allocate Rs. 5,000 crore in 2006-07.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,Jammu and Kashmir,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Government will continue to provide special assistance to Jammu and Kashmir. The State Plan for 2006-07 has been fixed at Rs. 2,300 crore. In addition, I propose to provide a sum of Rs. 848 crore for the J&K Reconstruction Plan, including Rs. 230 crore for the Baglihar Project. I also propose to provide special central Plan assistance of Rs. 1,300 crore to enable the State to undertake reforms in the power sector.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,Defence Expenditure,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Government has fulfilled the long-standing need of retired Armed Forces Personnel Below Officer Rank (PBOR) for better pensionary benefits. About 12 lakh PBOR have benefited to the tune of Rs. 460 crore with effect from 1 January 2006, and I am sure the House will welcome this decision.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"In view of the enhanced expenditure on modernisation of defence forces, I propose to increase the allocation for defence from Rs. 83,000 crore to Rs. 89,000 crore in 2006-07, and this will include Rs. 37,458 crore for capital expenditure.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,e-Governance,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"The National e-Governance Plan will be approved shortly, and 25 projects, in mission mode, will be launched in 2006-07. Among them is Project MCA-21 to enable companies to file returns electronically and a project for setting up common service centres and assigning unique ID to BPL families. It is Government’s intention to bring a number of services online, in a web-based mode, including applications under the Right to Information Act, applications for house sites, ration cards, transfers of teachers, inclusion in the electoral roll, filing of police complaint, and issue of birth/death certificates and copies of land records.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,Celebrating History and Heritage,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"In 2007, we will celebrate the 150th anniversary of the First War of Indian Independence, an event that shaped the destiny of the nation. To ensure that the event is observed in a befitting manner, I propose to make a provision of Rs. 10 crore for preparatory activities.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Two Gandhian institutions, the National Gandhi Museum, Rajghat and the Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Fund, Indore deserve support. I intend to provide Rs. 5 crore each to the corpus of these institutions in 2006-07.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"I am happy to inform the House that Kuttiyattam, Vedic Chanting and Ramlila have been declared ‘Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity’ by the UNESCO. These old art forms and oral traditions need to be safeguarded. Pending drawing up a detailed scheme, I propose to make an initial provision of Rs. 5 crore in 2006-07.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,FISCAL CONSOLIDATION,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,Twelfth Finance Commission,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram," The recommendations of the Twelfth Finance Commission (TFC) are being implemented. Cumulatively, State loans amounting to Rs. 1,03,710 crore have been consolidated so far. Under the new scheme of tax devolution, Rs. 94,402 crore will be released as the States’ share in the current year compared to Rs. 78,595 crore in 2004-05. As regards grants-in-aid, the amounts granted in 2004-05 and 2005-06 (RE) are Rs. 12,081 crore and Rs. 25,134 crore respectively. In 2006-07, both the tax devolution and the grants will be substantially higher. The States have never been so well provided, as you will find from the Budget papers.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"I may add that I have made appropriate provision in the Budget for debt consolidation and relief. I have also provided Rs. 3,000 crore towards compensation for VAT losses, if any, in 2006-07.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,Subsidies,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"The issue of subsidies is proving to be a divisive one, but I would urge Honourable Members that it is imperative that we make progress on this front if we are serious about targeting subsidies at the poor and the truly needy. My Ministry has held extensive discussions with stakeholders on three major subsidies, namely, food, fertilizer and petroleum. We have also sought the views of the general public. Working groups/committees have gone into the question of fertilizer and petroleum subsidies, the latest being the Dr. C. Rangarajan Committee. I would urge Members to help the Government evolve a consensus on the issue of subsidies.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,Gross Budgetary Support and Gross Fiscal Deficit,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, please allow me to draw your attention to two path breaking developments on the fiscal front. Firstly, the strategy of enhanced revenue mobilization through reasonable rates, better compliance and widening of the tax base is yielding tangible results. For the Centre, the gross tax-GDP ratio, after rising from 9.2 per cent in 2003-04 to 9.8 per cent in 2004-05, has increased further to 10.5 per cent in 2005-06 (RE). Government estimates that through better tax administration, it will increase to 11.2 per cent in 2006-07(BE).",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Secondly, the year 2004-05, for which the actuals are available, has proved to be a turning point. After 20 years, the Gross Fiscal Deficit is less than the Gross Budgetary Support for Plan in that year. What does this mean? This means that Government is not financing the Plan entirely through borrowing. Whether this trend continued in 2005-06 will be known only after the actuals are available. However, in the BE for 2006-07, I have been able to confine the gross fiscal deficit to a number much smaller than the gross budgetary support for the Plan.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Last year, reluctantly, I pressed the ‘pause’ button on fiscal correction. I had estimated the revenue deficit for 2005-06 at 2.7 per cent and the fiscal deficit at 4.3 per cent. I am happy to report that I have been proved wrong. We have improved upon both measures. According to revised estimates, the revenue deficit for the current year will be only 2.6 per cent and the fiscal deficit will be only 4.1 per cent.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,BUDGET ESTIMATES FOR 2006-07,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,I turn to the Budget Estimates for the next fiscal.,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,Plan Expenditure,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Plan expenditure for 2006-07 is estimated at Rs. 1,72,728 crore, up by 20.4 per cent. As a proportion of total expenditure, Plan expenditure has increased from 26.6 per cent in 2004-05 to 28.3 per cent in 2005-06 (RE) and further to 30.6 per cent in 2006-07 (BE). This points to the improvement in the quality of Government expenditure.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,Non-Plan Expenditure,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Non-Plan expenditure in 2006-07 is estimated to be Rs. 3,91,263 crore. The increase of 5.5 per cent over non-plan expenditure in 2005-06 (BE) is due to normal growth and is one of the smallest in recent years.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,Revenue Deficit and Fiscal Deficit,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the Budget Estimates for 2006-07, the total expenditure is estimated at Rs. 5,63,991 crore. I estimate total revenue receipts of the Central Government at Rs. 4,03,465 crore and the revenue expenditure at Rs. 4,88,192 crore. Consequently, the revenue deficit is estimated at Rs. 84,727 crore which is 2.1 per cent of the GDP. The fiscal deficit is estimated at Rs. 148,686 crore, which is 3.8 per cent of the GDP. I believe that I have redeemed my promise that the process of fiscal correction will be resumed in 2006-07.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,TAX PROPOSALS,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Mr. Speaker, I shall now present my tax proposals. In the UPA Government’s first Budget, and more so in the second, I had attempted significant tax reforms. The results are encouraging. In 2004-05, gross tax revenues (provisional actuals) increased by 19.9 per cent over the actuals of the previous year and, according to Revised Estimates, in 2005-06, they are expected to increase by 21.4 per cent over the provisional actuals of the previous year. These figures confirm our belief that we should keep our tax rates moderate and stable.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,Indirect Taxes,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"I shall begin with my proposals on indirect taxes. Firstly, customs duties.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"In line with the Government’s policy of reducing customs duties, I propose to reduce the peak rate for non-agricultural products from 15 per cent to 12.5 per cent. I believe that we are now only a short distance away from East Asian rates.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"As the peak rate comes down, there is a need to reduce the duty on raw materials and intermediates.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,The duty on primary steel is at 5 per cent. I propose to reduce the duty on alloy steel and primary and secondary non-ferrous metals from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent. This will also be the rate of duty for ferro alloys.,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"In 2004-05, in view of the high international prices of steel, I had reduced the import duty on steel melting scrap to zero. With prices of steel coming down, I propose to restore the duty to 5 per cent and bring it on par with primary steel.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"The duty on mineral products is now 15 per cent. I propose to reduce it to 5 per cent, with a few exceptions.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,I also propose to reduce the duty on ores and concentrates from 5 per cent to 2 per cent.,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,Refractories attract a duty of 10 per cent. A number of materials required for manufacture of refractories are also at 10 per cent or higher rates. I propose to reduce these duties to 7.5 per cent.,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Basic inorganic chemicals are crucial raw materials. I propose to reduce the duty from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. On basic cyclic and acyclic hydrocarbons and their derivatives, I propose to bring down the rate to 5 per cent. I also propose to reduce the duty on catalysts from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Plastics are important raw materials. Hence, I propose to reduce the duty on major bulk plastics like PVC, LDPE and PP from 10 per cent to 5 per cent. Simultaneously, the duty on naphtha for plastics will be reduced to nil.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"I propose to reduce the duty on styrene, EDC and VCM which are raw materials for plastics to 2 per cent.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"I propose to give some concessions to vital drugs. I propose to reduce the customs duty on 10 anti-AIDS and 14 anti-cancer drugs to 5 per cent. I also propose to reduce the duty on certain life saving drugs, kits and equipment from 15 per cent to 5 per cent. These drugs will also be exempt from excise duty and countervailing duty (CVD).",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Packaging machines serve a wide variety of industries, including food processing. I propose to reduce the duty on packaging machines from 15 per cent to 5 per cent.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"I propose to extend the concessional project rate of 10 per cent to pipeline projects for transportation of natural gas, crude petroleum and petroleum products.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Honourable Members would recall that last year I had taken the power to impose a CVD on all imports to compensate for State level taxes. This levy was applied only to imports of ITA bound items and their inputs, except IT software. After the introduction of VAT in most States, I have received representations from trade and industry that this levy should be extended to all imports. The argument is persuasive, and I propose to impose a CVD of 4 per cent on all imports with a few exceptions. Full credit of this duty will be allowed to manufacturers of excisable goods.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"In order to protect the domestic vanaspati industry, I propose to increase the customs duty on vanaspati to 80 per cent, the rate applicable to crude palm oil.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Export Oriented Units (EOUs) are allowed to clear their goods to the Domestic Tariff Area (DTA) at a concessional rate. With declining import duties, DTA units and EOUs should have a level playing field as regards excise duty or CVD. Hence, I propose to adjust the duty rates on clearances by EOUs to the DTA at 25 per cent of basic customs duty plus excise duty on like goods. This will still give the EOU a tariff advantage or, at any rate, in most cases, it will be on par with a DTA unit.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Finally, I have an important proposal that involves both excise and customs duties. Cotton textile industry has greatly benefited from the relief granted two years ago. The man-made textile industry is a growthand employment-driver. It deserves encouragement. Hence, I propose to reduce the excise duty on all man-made fibre yarn and filament yarn from 16 per cent to 8 per cent. Simultaneously, I propose to reduce the import duty on all man-made fibres and yarns from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. Consequently, the import duty on raw materials such as DMT, PTA and MEG will also be reduced from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. The import duty on paraxylene is proposed to be reduced to 2 per cent.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"I have a few proposals on the excise side. I reiterate that it is our intention to converge all rates at the CENVAT rate which is now at 16 per cent. There are only two items—aerated drinks and cars—that still attract the higher rate of 24 per cent. I propose to correct this substantially. I propose to reduce the excise duty on aerated drinks to 16 per cent. On cars, I propose to reduce the excise duty to 16 per cent, but only for small cars. A small car, for this purpose, will mean a car of length not exceeding 4,000 mm and with an engine capacity not exceeding 1,500 cc for diesel cars and not exceeding 1,200 cc for petrol cars. I am confident that industry will seize the opportunity to make India a hub for the manufacture of small and fuel-efficient cars.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,I propose to impose an 8 per cent excise duty on packaged software sold over the counter. Customized software and software packages downloaded from the internet will be exempt from this levy.,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"I propose to fully exempt from excise duty DVD Drives, Flash Drives and Combo Drives.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Many food items, including packaged items, attract nil excise duty. With a view to giving a fillip to the food processing industry, I propose to fully exempt from excise duty condensed milk, ice cream, preparations of meat, fish and poultry, pectins, pasta and yeast. Excise duty on readyto-eat packaged foods and instant food mixes, like dosa and idli mixes, will be reduced from 16 per cent to 8 per cent.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Since leather and footwear are thrust sectors, I propose to exempt from excise duty two vegetable tanning extracts, namely, quebracho and chestnut. Footwear carrying a retail sale price up to Rs. 250 is already exempt from excise duty. I propose to reduce excise duty on footwear with a retail sale price between Rs. 250 and Rs. 750 from 16 per cent to 8 per cent.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"At present LPG stoves up to a value of Rs. 2,000 attract excise duty of 8 per cent. I propose to extend the concessional rate to all LPG stoves without any value limit.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"To promote the use of energy efficient lamps, I propose to reduce the excise duty on compact fluorescent lamps from 16 per cent to 8 per cent.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"I propose to remove rate differences between different kinds of tableware and kitchenware. Consequently, glassware will attract excise duty of 16 per cent on par with ceramicware and plasticware.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Paper finds widespread use in education as well as in packaging. In order to encourage capacity addition, I propose to reduce excise duty on specified printing, writing and packing paper from 16 per cent to 12 per cent.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Domestically produced petroleum crude is subject to a cess under the Oil Industries Development Act. The rate of Rs. 1,800 per metric ton was fixed in 2002. After consulting the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, I propose to increase the cess to Rs. 2,500 per MT. I have been assured that this increase will be absorbed by the oil producing companies and have no impact on retail prices of petroleum products.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"There are two requests from trade and industry. I had exempted computers from excise duty in order to boost the use of computers. That purpose has been largely served. Domestic manufacturers have sought re-imposition of excise duty at 12 per cent in order to enable them to take CENVAT credit as well as to face competition from imports. I propose to accept the request. Since the 12 per cent excise duty will be eligible for full input tax credit, there should not be any impact on price.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"The second request is to impose excise duty on set top boxes. I propose to accept the request and levy an excise duty of 16 per cent and, at the same time, reduce the customs duty from 15 per cent to nil. This change will equalize the duty rates on various types of set top boxes.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"To round off, I would be failing in my duty if I did not raise the excise duty on cigarettes. Hence, I propose to increase the excise duty on cigarettes by about 5 per cent.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"The bane of excise and customs tariffs is the plethora of exemptions. On the basis of a comprehensive review, I propose to remove many exemptions that were granted through notifications. Broadly, exemptions that are end-use based or have outlived their utility or need certification or give rise to disputes are being rescinded, with only a few exceptions. The exemption for the SSI sector will, however, remain unchanged.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"We have also identified some more notifications which need to be removed. However, before taking a final view, I propose to put a list of such notifications on the Ministry’s website and invite comments.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"This leaves service tax. In 2005-06, the services sector is estimated to contribute 54 per cent of GDP. Naturally, it should also contribute significantly to the exchequer. Continuing in the direction followed in the last few years, I propose to bring more services under the service tax net. The new services to be covered include ATM operations, maintenance and management; registrars, share transfer agents and bankers to an issue; sale of space or time, other than in the print media, for advertisements; sponsorship of events, other than sports events, by companies; international air travel excluding economy class passengers; container services on rail, excluding the railway freight charges; business support services; auctioneering; recovery agents; ship management services; travel on cruise ships; and public relations management services.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,I also propose to expand the coverage of certain services now subject to service tax. I do not wish to burden the House with the details which are available in the Budget papers.,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"The leasing and hire purchase industry has faced some difficulty owing to the levy of service tax on all components of payments, including interest. I propose to rectify the anomaly. Accordingly, interest and instalments of the principal amount will be abated in calculating the value of the service.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"It is my sense that there is a large consensus that the country should move towards a national level Goods and Services Tax (GST) that should be shared between the Centre and the States. I propose that we set 1 April 2010 as the date for introducing GST. World over, goods and services attract the same rate of tax. That is the foundation of a GST. People must get used to the idea of a GST. Hence, we must progressively converge the service tax rate and the CENVAT rate. I propose to take one step this year and increase the service tax rate from 10 per cent to 12 per cent. Let me hasten to add that since service tax paid can be credited against service tax payable or excise duty payable, the net impact will be very small.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,Direct Taxes,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,I shall now turn to my proposals on direct taxes.,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,The good news is that there will be no change in the rates of personal income tax or corporate income tax.,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,The other piece of good news is that no new taxes are being imposed.,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,The one-by-six scheme under the Income Tax Act obliging certain categories of persons to file returns will stand abolished.,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"I propose to marginally revise certain tax rates in the quest for equity. While the corporate tax rate is 30 per cent, the rate under Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) is only 7.5 per cent of book profits. I propose to increase the rate of 10 per cent, which is still only one-third of the normal rate. I also propose to include long-term capital gains arising out of securities in calculating book profits. I have already allowed MATpaying companies to take credit for MAT over five years. I propose to extend the period to seven years as well as adjust MAT credit while calculating interest liability.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"The rates for the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) were fixed when prices of securities were much lower. Reflecting the increase in implicit capital gains in securities transactions, I propose an increase of 25 per cent, across the board, on all rates of STT.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Section 80IA of the Income Tax Act applies to infrastructure facilities. For developing an industrial park the terminal date is 31 March 2006. I propose to extend the period to 31 March 2009. For the power sector, in view of the ultra mega projects, I propose to extend the date to 31 March 2010.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Last year, I recast the provisions relating to savings. Fixed deposits were not included. There is a demand that fixed deposits of certain tenure should qualify for tax exemption. I propose to include investments in fixed deposits in scheduled banks for a term of not less than five years in section 80C of the Income Tax Act. I also propose to remove the limit of Rs. 10,000 in respect of contribution to certain pension funds in section 80CCC, subject to the overall ceiling of Rs. 1,00,000.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,I propose to align the definition of open-ended equity-oriented schemes of mutual funds in the Income Tax Act with the definition adopted by SEBI. I also propose to treat open-ended equity-oriented schemes and close-ended equity-oriented schemes on par for the purpose of exemption from dividend distribution tax.,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"I have revisited the exemptions in the Income Tax Act. As a result, I propose to remove the exemption under section 10(23G) which is not relevant when interest rates are moderate.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Cooperative banks, like any other bank, are lending institutions and should pay tax on their profits. Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) and Primary Cooperative Agricultural and Rural Development Banks (PCARDB) stand on a special footing and will continue to be exempt from tax under section 80P of the Income Tax Act. However, I propose to exclude all other cooperative banks from the scope of that section.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Section 54EC and section 54ED are tax shelters. I propose to restrict the scope of section 54EC to two institutions, viz., NHAI and REC. For NABARD, SIDBI and NHB, which are banks, we have already opened the route of zero coupon bonds to raise low cost funds. Government will, if needed, provide appropriate support to these institutions to enable them to access resources to fulfil their mandate effectively. I also propose to withdraw the benefit of section 54ED, which has become virtually redundant, with effect from 1 April 2006.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"The Standing Committee on Finance has expressed concern that many charitable institutions misuse the provisions of the Income Tax Act. I propose to focus on one misuse, namely, receiving anonymous or pseudonymous donations. Accordingly, I propose that anonymous or pseudonymous donations to wholly charitable institutions will be taxed at the highest marginal rate. Such donations to partly religious and partly charitable institutions/trusts will be taxed only if the donation is specifically for an educational or medical purpose. However, I make it clear that such donations to wholly religious institutions and religious trusts will not be covered by the new provision.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,Members of State Legislatures have complained that their constituency allowances are taxed differently from the constituency allowance received by Members of Parliament. I propose to remove the discrimination and treat them equally.,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"The Permanent Account Number (PAN) of the Department of Income Tax is the critical element in capturing incomes and expenditures. Scrutiny of Annual Information Returns (AIR) on high-value transactions reveals that 60 per cent of the transactions are without quoting PAN. Hence, I propose to take the power to issue PAN suo motu in certain cases. I also propose to take the power to direct persons to apply for PAN in certain cases. I propose to notify, in due course, more transactions for which quoting of PAN will be mandatory. I also propose to prescribe a few more transactions to be reported in AIRs.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Last year, I introduced two new taxes. The Banking Cash Transaction Tax (BCTT) has turned out to be a boon, not for the modest revenues it brought which was never its purpose, but for the remarkable trails that it has helped establish. To cite just one example, huge cash withdrawals in a bank branch in Chandni Chowk, noticed through the BCTT, led the Department of Income Tax to three entities which were carrying on the business of purchasing demand drafts from traders at a discount and helping the traders to avoid both sales tax and income tax. These entities would deposit the demand drafts in their own accounts and withdraw the cash. In a period of 18 months, they had laundered Rs. 1,500 crore. BCTT has also helped the Department to detect bogus bills, accommodation entries, artificial loss claims and dummy firms. I propose to continue the BCTT for some more time until the AIR system is able to capture all significant financial transactions.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) was introduced as a revenue raising measure. FBT can be justified on the principles of horizontal equity and vertical equity. Nevertheless, I have reviewed it with an open mind. I have also taken on board the views expressed by the apex chambers of commerce. I propose to make the following changes in chapter XII-H of the Income Tax Act:",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,•    Value the benefit in the form of ‘tour and travel’ at 5 per cent instead of 20 per cent;,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"•    Value the benefit in the form of ‘hospitality’ and ‘use of hotel boarding and lodging facilities’, in the case of airline companies and shipping industry, at 5 per cent instead of 20 per cent;",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,•    Exclude the expenses on free samples of medicines and of medical equipment distributed to doctors;,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,•    Exclude the expenses incurred on brand ambassador and celebrity endorsement; and,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"•    Prescribe a threshold of Rs. 1,00,000 under section 115WB(1)(c) so that only a contribution by an employer to an approved superannuation fund in excess of Rs. 1,00,000 per year per employee will attract FBT. Under section 80C there is already an exemption up to Rs. 1,00,000 for contribution by an employee to an approved superannuation fund. Honourable Members will note that, under these two provisions, there can now be a taxexempt contribution up to Rs. 2,00,000 per year for the benefit of an employee. This allowance, I believe, is generous enough in the case of an overwhelming majority of employees.",,,,,

2006-07,P. Chidambaram,Modernizing Tax Administration,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"I am glad to inform the House that technology is being increasingly employed to modernize tax administration. The Departments of Income Tax and Customs and Central Excise will undergo Business Process Reengineering (BPR). Nationwide networks will connect 745 income tax offices in 510 cities and 550 customs and central excise offices in 245 cities, creating national databases. National data centres, data warehousing facilities and disaster recovery sites are being set up. Jurisdiction-free filing of returns, online tracking of status of accounts and refunds of income tax will be possible. Introduction of a risk management system and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) in the Customs Department will reduce dwell time for cargo. E-payments of customs and excise duties will be possible. Both Departments will have fully computerised networks by end 2006.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Our Government’s two Budgets have seen many innovations—the Gender Budget, the Outcome Budget, etc. Today, I place before the House another innovation—a statement on revenue foregone, known worldwide as tax expenditure statement. This statement captures the departures from the normal tax regime. This exercise is a first attempt that will be fine tuned in the years to come.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,VAT and CST,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"The House is aware that most States have implemented VAT with effect from 1 April 2005, and the unanimous opinion is that VAT has been a resounding success. I hope that the non-VAT States will soon join the mainstream, because the next stage of reform depends on all States implementing VAT. The Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers has recommended that Central Sales Tax (CST) be phased out, and have requested the Centre to compensate them for the expected loss of revenue. Government has proposed that the loss of revenue may be compensated through monetary and non-monetary measures which, taken together, will ensure that the States’ revenues remain buoyant. Once the Empowered Committee and the Government reach an agreement, I shall return to the House with firm proposals, including legislative changes and a supplementary demand.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"In the meanwhile, there is an urgent matter connected with CST and VAT which has to be attended to. It has become imperative to moderate the price of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) for domestic use. States are taxing LPG (domestic) at high rates. They should also bear a portion of the burden of high prices of petroleum products. Hence, in order to moderate the price of LPG (domestic), I propose to include LPG (domestic) in the list of ‘declared goods’ under the CST Act.",,,,,

2006-07,P. Chidambaram,Conclusion,,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe that the world has recognized the potential of India. It is now for us, the generation to which has been given the privilege of carrying the torch, to rediscover the greatness of this country and the potential of its people. The young people of India are building castles, it may appear that those castles are in the air, but as Henry David Thoreau said: “If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them.” It is our duty to put the foundations on which the young can build their castles. The UPA Government has pledged itself to that task.",,,,,
2006-07,P. Chidambaram,"Over a hundred years ago, a restless young man in his quest for the core of all spirituality admonished his fellow men in the following words: “We reap what we sow. We are the makers of our own fate. The wind is blowing; those vessels whose sails are unfurled catch it, and go forward on their way, but those which have their sails furled do not catch the wind. Is that the fault of the wind? We make our own destiny.” Those are the immortal words of Swami Vivekananda. Let us believe in our destiny, let us make our future.",,,,,

2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,I. A MID-TERM REPORT CARD ON THE ECONOMY,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"2. In November 2006, the UPA Government crossed the midpoint of its term of office. A midterm report card can now be presented. There are many pluses and a few minuses, and I shall deal with both candidly. The biggest plus is that the growth rate of GDP has improved from 7.5 per cent in 2004-05 to 9 per cent (Quick Estimate) in 2005-06 and, according to Advance Estimate, to 9.2 per cent in 2006-07. The average growth rate in the three years of the UPA Government is, therefore, 8.6 per cent. Thanks to this impressive performance, despite the poor start in 2002-03, the growth target set for the Tenth Plan of 8 per cent will be nearly achieved.",,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"3. Manufacturing is the main driver of growth, and this augurs well for the future. In the three years of the UPA Government, the growth rate in manufacturing has accelerated from 8.7 per cent to 9.1 per cent and further to 11.3 per cent. The services sector continues to maintain impressive growth and has recorded, in the three years, a growth rate of 9.6 per cent, 9.8 per cent and 11.2 per cent respectively.",,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"4. On the other hand, the agriculture sector has witnessed sharp ups and downs. Average growth during the Tenth Plan period is estimated at 2.3 per cent, which is below the desired level of 4 per cent a year. About 115 million families are classified as farming families. Furthermore, a country with a large population has to be nearly self-sufficient in essential food items; otherwise supply constraints could upset macro economic stability and growth prospects. Hence, agriculture must top the agenda of the policy makers and must hold the first charge on our resources. In a short while, I shall place before this House a number of proposals in this regard.",,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,Income and Savings,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"5. To continue with the report card, per capita income in 2005-06, in real terms, increased by 7.4 per cent, and the savings rate has been estimated at 32.4 per cent and the investment rate at 33.8 per cent. Intuitively, I believe that these high rates have continued in the current year too.",,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"6. The UPA Government has remained committed to economic reforms, fiscal prudence and monetary stability.",,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"7. Revenues are buoyant for the third year in succession. We have garnered additional revenues and, as Honourable Members will notice presently, I have put these revenues to good use to promote inclusive growth, equity and social justice - goals that are at the core of the National Common Minimum Programme (NCMP) and close to the hearts of the UPA, its Chairperson and the Prime Minister.",,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,Outlook on Inflation,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"8. Until February 2, 2007, bank credit, year on year, had grown by 29.6 per cent. Money supply (M3) had expanded by 21.3 per cent. Foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 180 billion. While these are concomitant features of high growth, it cannot be denied that these monetary trends have put pressure on prices. Global commodity prices have also exerted pressure on domestic prices. At the same time, supply constraints have emerged in some essential commodities such as wheat, pulses and edible oils. Consequently, average inflation in",,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"2006-07 is estimated at between 5.2 and 5.4 per cent, which is higher than 4.4 per cent last year. I wish to reiterate Government's concern over inflation. Government has already taken a number of measures on the fiscal, monetary and supply sides to maintain price stability and, if required, will not hesitate to take more measures. When the UPA Government assumed office in 2004, the inflation graph was on the rise; but we succeeded in moderating inflation and we are confident that we can moderate the present inflationary trend too.",,,,,

2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,III. HERALDING THE ELEVENTH FIVE YEAR PLAN,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"11. The year 2007-08 will mark the beginning of the Eleventh Plan. The declared objective is ""Faster and More Inclusive Growth"". I can state with confidence that, on the eve of the Plan, the economy is in a stronger position than ever before. It therefore behoves us to set higher goals. The Approach Paper to the Eleventh Plan states that the Plan ""will aim at putting the economy on a sustainable growth trajectory with a growth rate of approximately 10 per cent by the end of its period."" Among the other objectives of the Plan are growth of 4 per cent in the agriculture sector, faster employment creation, reducing disparities across regions and ensuring access to basic physical infrastructure as well as health and education services to all. I have kept these objectives in mind while allocating resources to various sectors.",,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,Gross Budgetary Support,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"12. Notwithstanding some constraints, I propose to increase substantially the Gross Budgetary Support (GBS) for the Plan. In 2006-07, the GBS was fixed at Rs.172,728 crore and, of this, support to the Central Plan was Rs.131,284 crore. GBS for 2007-08 will be increased to Rs.205,100 crore. Out of this, the Central Plan will receive Rs.154,939 crore.",,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,Allocations for Major Sectors,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"13. For Bharat Nirman, as against Rs.18,696 crore (including the NER component) in 2006-07, I propose to provide Rs.24,603 crore in 2007-08, which marks an increase of 31.6 per cent.",,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"14. The education and health sectors will also receive substantial funds. In 2007-08, I propose to enhance the allocation for education by 34.2 per cent to Rs.32,352 crore and for health and family welfare by 21.9 per cent to Rs.15,291 crore.",,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,

2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"15. In allocating resources, school education must have primacy. Hence, I propose to increase the allocation for school education by about 35 per cent from Rs.17,133 crore in 2006-07 to Rs.23,142 crore in 2007-08.",,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"16. Out of this amount, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) will be provided Rs.10,671 crore. Further, I propose to increase the provision for strengthening teachers training institutions from Rs.162 crore to Rs.450 crore. Next year, we will appoint 200,000 more teachers and construct 500,000 more class rooms.",,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"17. The Mid-day Meal Scheme will be provided Rs.7,324 crore next year. In addition to covering children in primary classes, beginning 2007-08, we propose to cover children in upper primary classes in 3,427 educationally backward blocks.",,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"18. The transfer to Prarambhik Shiksha Kosh will increase from Rs.8,746 crore to Rs.10,393 crore.",,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"19. As more students complete upper primary classes, it is necessary to increase access to secondary education. Schemes for this purpose are under formulation, and I propose to double the provision for secondary education from Rs.1,837 crore in 2006-07 to Rs.3,794 crore in 2007-08.",,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,Means-Cum-Merit Scholarships,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"20. While the SSA has improved the enrolment ratio in schools to 96 per cent, the drop out ratio continues to be high. The critical year appears to be transition from class VIII to class IX. In order to arrest the drop out ratio and encourage students to continue their education beyond class VIII, I propose to introduce a National Means-cum-Merit Scholarship Scheme. Selection will be made through a national test from among students who have passed class VIII. Each student will be given Rs.6,000 per year for study in classes IX, X, XI and XII. I propose that 100,000 scholarships may be awarded every year. In order to fund this programme, I intend to create a corpus fund of Rs.750 crore this year, and add a like amount to the fund every year over the next three years. Accordingly, a sum of Rs.750 crore will be placed with the State Bank of India, and the yield from the fund will be used for awarding the scholarships.",,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,Drinking Water and Sanitation,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"21. 55,512 habitations and 34,000 schools have been provided drinking water supply till December, 2006 under the Rajiv Gandhi Drinking Water Mission. More ambitious targets have been set for 2007-08 to deal with both non-coverage and slippage. I propose to enhance the allocation for the Mission from Rs.4,680 crore in 2006-07 to Rs.5,850 crore in 2007-08.",,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,

2007-08,P. Chidambaram,Health Sector; National Rural Health Mission,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"23. In the second year of its implementation, the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) is on schedule to meet its timelines. The institutional integration of all the health schemes at the district and lower levels has been achieved. All districts in the country will complete preparation of District Health Action Plans by March 2007. The major emphasis will be on mother and child care and on the prevention and treatment of communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria. Through Monthly Health Days (MHD) organised at Anganwadi centres, convergence is sought to be achieved among various programmes such as immunization, ante natal care as well as nutrition and sanitation.",,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"24. I am happy to report that 320,000 Associated Social Health Activists (ASHAs) have been recruited and over 200,000 have received orientation training. Besides, 90,000 link workers have been selected by the States. With trained ASHAs in place, I am confident there will be significant improvement in health care in rural areas. The Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Sidha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) systems are also being mainstreamed into the health delivery system at all levels. I propose to increase the allocation for NRHM from Rs.8,207 crore in 2006-07 to Rs.9,947 crore in 2007-08.",,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,HIV/AIDS,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"25. Government has brought HIV/AIDS out of the closet and promised bold and determined efforts to achieve zero-level growth of the disease. The epidemic will be deemed 'stabilised' if the prevalence rate is less than one per cent of the population. National Aids Control Programme (NACP)-III, starting in 2007-08 and building on NACP-I and NACP-II, will target the high risk groups in all the States. We will expand access to condoms and ensure universal access to blood screening and safe blood. More hospitals will provide treatment to prevent transmission of HIV/AIDS from mother to child. Support will be given to the protocol on paediatric dosage developed by Indian doctors and launched in November 2006. For the year 2007-08, I propose to step up the provision for the AIDS control programme to Rs.969 crore.",,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,

2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"26. Last year, I had expressed the hope that polio will be eliminated from the country by December 2007. However, there was an outbreak in western Uttar Pradesh in early 2006. The strategy for polio eradication has been revised. The number of polio rounds will be increased, monovalent vaccine will be introduced, and there will be intensive coverage in the 20 high risk districts of Uttar Pradesh and 10 districts of Bihar. The programme has been integrated into the NRHM. The ASHAs and the Anganwadi workers will visit every household and track every child for the immunization programme. To achieve the goal of eliminating polio, I propose to provide Rs.1,290 crore in 2007-08.",,,,,

2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"27. In the second phase of expansion of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), Government has sanctioned 173 ICDS projects, 107,274 Anganwadi centres and 25,961 mini-Anganwadi centres. Government is committed to expand the scheme in order to cover all habitations and settlements during the Eleventh Plan and to reach out to pregnant women, lactating mothers and all children below the age of six. I propose to increase the allocation for ICDS from Rs.4,087 crore in 2006-07 to Rs.4,761 crore in 2007-08.",,,,,

2007-08,P. Chidambaram,National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"28. The National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) was launched on February 2, 2006. The pace of implementation varies from State to State. Since NREGS is a demand-driven scheme carrying a legal guarantee of employment, the budget allocation would have to be supplemented according to need. I therefore propose to make an initial allocation of Rs.12,000 crore (including NER component) for NREGS. I am also happy to announce that NREGS will be expanded from the current level of 200 districts to 330 districts. In addition, I have provided Rs.2,800 crore for Sampoorna Gramin Rozgar Yojana (SGRY) for rural employment in the districts not covered by NREGS.",,,,,

Continuing the practice that was started in 2005-06, a separate statement on the schemes for the welfare of Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) is placed in the Budget documents. The allocation in 2007-08 for SCs and STs has been substantially enhanced. In respect of schemes benefiting only SCs and STs, I have increased the allocation to Rs.3,271 crore. In respect of schemes with at least 20 per cent of the benefits earmarked for SCs and STs, I have increased the allocation to Rs.17,691 crore.",,,,,

I propose to increase the provision for these scholarships from Rs.440 crore in 2006-07 to Rs.611 crore in 2007-08.

The target of Rs.175,000 crore set for 2006-07 will be exceeded comfortably and is likely to reach Rs.190,000 crore. This year, until December 2006, 53.37 lakh new farmers were brought into the institutional credit system.

I therefore propose to expand the Integrated Oilseeds, Oil palm, Pulses and Maize Development programme. There will be a sharper focus on scaling up the production of breeder, foundation and certified seeds. The Indian Institute of Pulses Research (IIPR), Kanpur, the National and State level seeds corporations, agricultural universities, ICAR centres, KRIBHCO, IFFCO and NAFED as well as large private sector companies will be invited to submit plans to scale up the production of seeds.

2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"54. Depletion of ground water has assumed grave proportions. The Central Ground Water Board has identified 1,065 assessment blocks in the country as 'over-exploited' or 'critical'. Over 80 per cent of these blocks are in 100 districts in seven States. The strategy for ground water recharge is to divert rain water into 'dug wells'. Each structure will cost about Rs.4,000. The requirement is seven million structures, including about two million structures on land belonging to small and marginal farmers. I propose to provide 100 per cent subsidy to small and marginal farmers and 50 per cent subsidy to other farmers. Ministry of Water Resources will finalise the scheme shortly. In anticipation, I intend to transfer a sum of Rs.1,800 crore to NABARD. The amount will be held in escrow and will be disbursed through the lead bank of the district concerned to the beneficiaries.",,,,,

I therefore propose that the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) may set up one teaching-cum-demonstration model of water harvesting in each of 32 selected State Agricultural Universities and ICAR institutes. Each institution will train 100 trainers and 1,000 farmers every year in two-week and one-week programmes respectively. Based on estimates of recurring costs, I intend to provide an interest free loan of Rs.3 crore to each institution to create a corpus fund. The yield from the fund will be used for implementing the training programme. The total cost is estimated at Rs.100 crore.",,,,,

According to Revised Estimates, this will rise to Rs.22,452 crore, and there is a demand for more money. While fertilisers should indeed be subsidised, we must find an alternative method of delivering the subsidy directly to the farmer.

2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"60. Agricultural Insurance Corporation (AIC) has been running a pilot weather insurance scheme since Kharif 2004 and it appears to be a more promising risk mitigation scheme. Hence, Government will ask AIC to start a weather based crop insurance scheme on a pilot basis in two or three States, in consultation with the State Governments concerned, as an alternative to the NAIS.

2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"64. One of the commitments made in the NCMP is that Government will introduce a social security scheme for unorganised workers. A committee chaired by Dr. Arjun Sengupta has given its report which is under consideration. Pending a decision, in order to signal the UPA Government's concern for the welfare of unorganised workers, I propose to make a beginning. I propose to extend death and disability insurance cover through Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) to rural landless households under a new scheme called 'Aam Admi Bima Yojana' (AABY). According to NSS Report No. 491, the estimate of such households is about 1.5 crore. By end March 2007, 70 lakh households will be covered through existing schemes of the LIC with the support of some State Governments and the social security fund with the LIC. Under AABY, I propose to cover the rural landless households which enjoy no cover at all today, and the number may be actually more than what is indicated in the NSS report. The head of the family or one earning member in the family will be insured. The Central Government will bear 50 per cent of the premium of Rs.200 per year per person and I would urge the State Governments to come forward to bear the other 50 per cent on behalf of the beneficiaries. Taking into account the annual cost to the Central Government, I intend to place a sum of Rs.1,000 crore in a fund that will be maintained by LIC. I propose to finalise the scheme in consultation with State Governments and begin to implement it in 2007-08.",,,,,

2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"102. To sustain a high level of economic growth, it is essential to have a reservoir of skilled and trained manpower. Shortages have already emerged in a number of sectors. Moreover, we can take advantage of the demographic dividend thrown up by an increase in the working age population only if our young men and women have the required skills. The Prime Minister spoke of a Vocational Education Mission in his Independence Day address in 2006. A taskforce in the Planning Commission is chalking out strategies for vocational education programmes. Alternate models may be adopted, but the approach will be based on public-private partnership.

2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"103. Honourable Members will recall that Government had taken up a programme for upgradation of 500 ITIs over five years beginning 2005. Revised courses in the first lot of 100 upgraded ITIs were started in August 2005 and in the second lot of 100 upgraded ITIs in August 2006. I expect that another 300 ITIs will be covered by August 2009. That would still leave 1,396 Government ITIs.",,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"104. I propose that the 1,396 ITIs be upgraded into centres of excellence in specific trades and skills under public-private partnership. Under the proposed scheme, the State Government, as the owner of the ITI, will continue to regulate admissions and fees; the new management will be given academic and financial autonomy; and the Central Government will provide financial assistance by way of seed money. ITIs will be encouraged to start a second shift. Once a tripartite MoU is signed among the three stakeholders, I propose to grant an interest free loan up to Rs.2.5 crore to each ITI for upgradation and revision of courses. I seek the cooperation of State Governments in upgrading at least 300 ITIs every year, beginning 2007-08, under the PPP mode. I have kept aside Rs.750 crore for this purpose.",,,,,

2007-08,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"105. Among the disadvantaged sections of the society are physically challenged persons. They face difficulties in obtaining regular employment. In order to incentivise employers in the organised sector to provide regular employment, I propose a scheme whereunder Government will reward the employer once the physically challenged employee is regularised and is enrolled under the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and the Employees State Insurance (ESI). Under the scheme, Government will reimburse the employer's contribution to the EPF and ESI for the first three years. Government is ready to support the creation of about 100,000 jobs every year for physically challenged persons with a salary limit of Rs.25,000 per month. I estimate the cost to Government at Rs.150 crore per annum rising to Rs.450 crore per annum when the scheme is fully rolled out. I have therefore earmarked Rs.1,800 crore.",,,,,

2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"106. World over, debt management is distinct from monetary management. The establishment of a Debt Management Office (DMO) in the Government has been advocated for quite some time. The fiscal consolidation achieved so far has encouraged us to take the first step. Accordingly, I propose to set up an autonomous DMO and, in the first phase, a Middle Office will be set up to facilitate the transition to a full-fledged DMO.",,,,,

At present, India extends development cooperation through a number of Ministries and agencies and the total sum is about US$ 1 billion per annum. It is felt that all activities relating to development cooperation should be brought under one umbrella. Accordingly, Government proposes to establish the India International Development Cooperation Agency (IIDCA).

2007-08,P. Chidambaram,"108. India is not a significant contributor to green house gas (GHG) emissions, nor will it be so in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, in line with the principle of ""common but differentiated responsibility"", India has taken important steps to mitigate GHG emissions and adapt to climate change impact. India has also strongly promoted the clean development mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol and has the world's largest number of CDM projects. Nevertheless, India is among the countries more vulnerable to climate change. Hence, Government proposes to appoint an expert committee to study the impact of climate change on India and identify the measures that we may have to take in the future.",,,,,

We owe it to our people to make the Commonwealth Games an equally memorable event. I propose to provide in 2007-08 Rs.150 crore to the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports and Rs.350 crore to the Delhi Government for the Games.

These are Sabarmati Ashram, Ahmedabad; Sevagram Ashram, Wardha; Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Pune; and Rajendra Smriti Sanghrahalaya, Patna.

VAT revenues of the implementing States increased by 13.8 per cent in 2005-06 and by 24.3 per cent in the first nine months of 2006-07. The next logical step is to phase out Central Sales Tax (CST). I am glad to report that the Central Government has reached an agreement with State Governments to phase out CST. Consequently, the CST rate will be reduced from 4 per cent to 3 per cent with effect from April 1, 2007.

2008-09,P. Chidambaram,I. THE ECONOMY: AN OVERVIEW,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,"2. Honourable Members! The India growth story, so far, has been an absorbing and inspiring tale. Beginning January 1, 2005, the economy has recorded a growth rate of over 8 per cent in 12 successive quarters up to December 31, 2007. In the first three years of the UPA Government, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by 7.5 per cent, 9.4 per cent and 9.6 per cent, resulting in an unprecedented average growth rate of 8.8 per cent. In the current year too, according to the Advance Estimates by the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO), the growth rate will be 8.7 per cent - although I am confident that we will maintain the average of 8.8 per cent. The drivers of growth continue to be ""services"" and ""manufacturing"", which are estimated to grow at 10.7 per cent and 9.4 per cent, respectively.",,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,"3. Nevertheless, 2007-08 has been the most challenging of the last four years. At the beginning of the year, the outlook for the global economy was benign. Our economy, thanks to our own policies as well as globalisation, was poised to record another year of high growth: in fact, the first half of 2007-08 returned a growth of 9.1 per cent. However, since August 2007, the financial markets in the developed countries have witnessed considerable turbulence that has not yet abated. The consequences for developing countries are also not yet clear.",,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,"4. Moreover, agriculture has struck a disappointing note. Despite a fine start in the first half of 2007-08, the growth rate for the whole year in agriculture is estimated at only 2.6 per cent.",,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,"5. There are other downside risks too. World prices of crude oil, commodities and food grains have risen sharply in the period April 2007 to January 2008. The position of crude oil is well known to this House. Among commodities, the prices of iron ore, copper, lead, tin, urea etc are elevated. The prices of wheat and rice have increased in the world market by 88 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively. All these trends are inflationary, and there is pressure on domestic prices, especially on the prices of food articles. Consequently, the management of the supply side of food articles will be the most crucial task in the ensuing year.",,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,"6. We have also witnessed capital inflows that are far in excess of the current account deficit. This poses a challenge to monetary management. The solution lies in increasing the absorptive capacity of the economy in the medium term. In the short term, it is our responsibility to manage the flows more actively. Government will, in consultation with the RBI, continue to monitor the situation closely and take such temporary measures as may be necessary to moderate the capital flows consistent with the objective of monetary and financial stability.",,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,"7. Keeping inflation under check is one of the cornerstones of our policy. Recently, the Prime Minister declared, ""I think no Government in our country can be oblivious to the objective of ensuring reasonable price stability without hurting the growth process."" There can be no clearer enunciation of policy. However, since the downside risks have increased worldwide, we must be vigilant and prepared to make swift adjustments in our policies to achieve the goal of growth with price stability.",,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,"8. Let me first deal with agriculture, briefly for the present, and at some length later. The Ministry of Agriculture has estimated that the total output of food grains in 2007-08 will be 219.32 million tonnes and that will be an all time record. In particular, production of rice is estimated at 94.08 million tonnes; maize at 16.78 million tonnes; soya bean at 9.45 million tonnes; and cotton at 23.38 million bales (of 170 kg each) - and each of these will be an all time record. Government is conscious that while a lot has been done, a lot more needs to be done. Since the last Budget, Government has formulated and announced the National Policy for Farmers. Besides, Government has launched the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana with an outlay of Rs.25,000 crore and the National Food Security Mission with an outlay of Rs.4,882 crore. Both schemes will be implemented during the Eleventh Five Year Plan period. We are determined to become self-sufficient in food grains. Presently, I shall place before this House a number of new initiatives in the agriculture sector.",,,,,

2008-09,P. Chidambaram,The Growth Story: Faster and more inclusive,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,"9. To return to the India growth story, I am of the firm belief that we owe our sustained progress to the policy of economic reforms first ushered in by a Congress Government and now carried forward by the UPA Government.",,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,"10. If 1984 and 1991 were turning points in the history of India's economy, 2004 was another turning point. Confident that high growth was sustainable, the UPA Government had declared in the National Common Minimum Programme its intention to make growth more inclusive. Sir, I ask this House, respectfully, to judge our record on inclusive growth from the following sample of facts:",,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,

2008-09,P. Chidambaram,"11. Bharat Nirman has made impressive progress in 2007-08. This ambitious programme is now over 1,000 days old. At the current pace, on each day of the year 290 habitations are provided with drinking water and 17 habitations are connected through an all weather road. On each day of the year 52 villages are provided with telephones and 42 villages are electrified. On each day of the year 4,113 rural houses are completed.",,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,"12. Mr. Speaker, just as I sat down to write this speech, I received a slim volume titled ""Indira Gandhi - Selected Sayings"". Within minutes, I found this gem and I quote, ""The more one does, the more one attempts, the more one is capable of doing"". What I have narrated so far is indeed proof of more inclusive growth, but if you ask me ""can we do better?"", my answer would be ""we can and we should."" Budget 2008-09 is about raising our sights and doing more and doing better.",,,,,

2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,THE CRUCIAL SECOND YEAR,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,"13. The Eleventh Plan has started on a note of robust growth. Never before did we start a Plan with a first year growth rate of 8.7 per cent. Government regards the second year of the Plan as extremely critical to the success of the Plan. 2008-09 should be a year of consolidation; of securing the ongoing programmes on firm financial foundations; of close monitoring of implementation and enforcing accountability; and of measuring the outcomes in terms of the targets achieved as well as their quality. The Plan documents assumed that the Gross Budgetary Support (GBS) in the second year would be Rs.228,725 crore. In our view, that will not be enough. Hence, I propose to increase the GBS to Rs.243,386 crore, which will represent an increase of Rs.38,286 crore over the allocation in 2007-08.",,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,"14. Out of the GBS, the allocation for the Central Plan will be Rs.179,954 crore, marking an increase of 16 per cent over 2007-08.",,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,

Considering the fact that there are over 30 lakh SHGs credit-linked to banks, I propose to single out this category for special attention. I propose to ask LIC to rapidly scale up the scheme and cover all women SHGs that are credit-linked to banks. Since one-half of the premium is subsidized through the Social Security Fund, I propose to contribute Rs.500 crore to the corpus of the fund with the assurance that annual contributions will be made as the scheme is scaled up.

Recently, Government has approved 14 projects that satisfy certain criteria as national projects and three of them alone would require Rs.7,000 crore during the Eleventh Plan period. Having regard to the magnitude of the challenge, I propose to establish the Irrigation and Water Resources Finance Corporation (IWRFC) with an initial capital of Rs.100 crore contributed by the Central Government. State Governments and other financial institutions will be invited to contribute to the equity. It is our intention to mobilise the very large resources that will be required to fund major and medium irrigation projects.

Sir, while I am confident that the schemes and measures that I have listed above will give a boost to the agriculture sector, the question that still looms large is what we should do about the indebtedness of farmers. Honourable members will recall that Government had appointed a Committee under Dr. R. Radhakrishna to examine all aspects of agricultural indebtedness. The Committee has since submitted its report and it is in the public domain. The Committee had made a number of recommendations but stopped short of recommending waiver of agricultural loans. However, Government is conscious of the dimensions of the problem and is sensitive to the difficulties of the farming community, especially the small and marginal farmers. Having carefully weighed the pros and cons of debt waiver and having taken into account the resource position, I place before this House a scheme of debt waiver and debt relief for farmers:",,,,,

In respect of other farmers, there will be a one time settlement (OTS) scheme for all loans that were overdue on December 31, 2007 and which remained unpaid until February 29, 2008. Under the OTS, a rebate of 25 per cent will be given against payment of the balance of 75 per cent.",,,,,

There has been some moderation in the index of production of the six core infrastructure industries as well as in the overall index of industrial production for the period April-December 2007-08.

The silver lining is that the growth in capital goods is still very high at 20.2 per cent, indicating that industry continues to make huge capital investments and has a positive outlook about the future. Manufacturing industries that have grown more slowly than the average include food products, cotton textiles, textile products including apparel, paper and transport equipment. Among the reasons for the moderation are a rise in interest rates and the appreciation of the Rupee. There are limits to monetary policy accommodation, especially when the need is to maintain price stability. However, some steps can be taken on the fiscal side and I shall, presently, place before the House some proposals in order to stimulate industrial growth. Our goal is to take the manufacturing growth rate to a double digit. This will also call for more reforms in the coal and electricity sectors as well as confronting oligopolistic tendencies in the cement and steel sectors.",,,,,

In order to give a fillip to the sector, I propose to create a risk capital fund in the Small Industries and Development Bank of India (SIDBI). As on January 31, 2008, the Credit Guarantee Trust with SIDBI had extended guarantees to 89,129 units for an amount of Rs.2,479 crore.

Relief was given to exporters in three tranches amounting to over Rs.8,000 crore. I may note that the interest cost of sterilization through market stabilization bonds (MSS), estimated at Rs.8,351 crore for the whole year is, in a sense, subsidy to the export sector.

2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,100. India is poised to reap a 'demographic dividend' because the size of its working age population will increase from about 77.5 crore in 2008 to a likely peak of 95 crore in 2026. The 'dividend' can prove illusory if the workforce does not acquire the skills to support a knowledge and technology driven economy.,,,,,

2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,"101. Today, skill development programmes are diffused and administered by a number of ministries/departments. I have no intention of interfering with these sector-specific programmes. However, there is a compelling need to launch a world-class skill development programme, in mission mode, that will address the challenge of imparting the skills required by a growing economy. Both the structure and the leadership of the mission must be such that the programme can be scaled up quickly to cover the whole country. Hence, I propose to establish a non-profit corporation and entrust the mission to that corporation. It is my intention to garner about Rs.15,000 crore as capital from Governments, the public and private sector, and bilateral and multilateral sources. I shall begin by putting Rs.1,000 crore as Government's equity in the proposed non-profit corporation.",,,,,

Strengthening the PDS would mean adequate supplies, reasonable subsidies and efficient delivery of the subsidized food. An idea that has been growing is to deliver subsidies to the target group through smart cards. Finally, I have found two willing partners - the State of Haryana and the Union Territory of Chandigarh. They will introduce, on a pilot basis, a smart card based delivery system to deliver food grains under the PDS in Haryana and Chandigarh, respectively. I thank the Chief Minister of Haryana and the Administrator of Chandigarh and promise them full support and cooperation in making a success of the pilot scheme.",,,,,

Reflecting the higher cost of construction, I propose to enhance the subsidy per unit in respect of new houses sanctioned after April 1, 2008 from Rs.25,000 to Rs.35,000 in plain areas and from Rs.27,500 to Rs.38,500 in hill/difficult areas. The subsidy for upgradation of houses will be increased from Rs.12,500 per unit to Rs.15,000. A beneficiary will still need own funds to complete the house.

Work is in progress. Even while adhering to the principle of ""common but differentiated responsibility"" we can - and we must - do a number of things in our self-interest. We can promote clean technology products; we can review fuel emission and efficiency regulations; we can replace wood by solar as the fuel of common use; we can encourage the use of gas which is the most benign hydrocarbon; we can set up a trading platform for carbon emissions; we can build sustainable greenfield cities; and we can do more.

In order to redouble our effort to protect the tiger, I propose to make a one time grant of Rs.50 crore to the National Tiger Conservation Authority. The bulk of the grant will be used to raise, arm and deploy a special Tiger Protection Force.",,,,,

2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,"115. Robust economic growth has thrown up many new challenges, among them the need to put in place effective monitoring, evaluation and accounting systems for the large sums of money that are disbursed by the Central Government to State Governments, district level agencies and other implementing agencies. I think we do not pay enough attention to outcomes as we do to outlays; or to physical targets as we do to financial targets; or to quality as we do to quantity. Government therefore proposes to put in place a Central Plan Schemes Monitoring System (CPSMS) that will be implemented as a Plan scheme of the Planning Commission. A comprehensive Decision Support System and Management Information System will also be established. The intended outcome is to generate and monitor scheme-wise and State-wise releases for about 1,000 Central Plan and centrally sponsored schemes in 2008-09.",,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,116. Government also intends to strengthen evaluation. Some ministries have started concurrent evaluation. This needs to be supplemented by independent evaluations conducted by research institutions. The Planning Commission will authorise such evaluations of the major schemes and complete the task by the time of the mid-term review of the Eleventh Plan.,,,,,

2008-09,P. Chidambaram,117. I shall now turn to the Budget Estimates for 2008-09.,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,"118. The estimate of Plan Expenditure is placed at Rs.243,386 crore. As a proportion of total expenditure, it will be 32.4 per cent.",,,,,

2008-09,P. Chidambaram,Revenue Deficit and Fiscal Deficit,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,120. It is widely acknowledged that the fiscal position of the country has improved tremendously. I am happy to report that the revenue deficit for the current year will be 1.4 per cent (against a BE of 1.5 per cent) and the fiscal deficit will be 3.1 per cent (against a BE of 3.3 per cent).,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,"121. Further progress will be made in 2008-09. The revenue receipts of the Central Government for 2008-09 are projected at Rs.602,935 crore and the revenue expenditure at Rs.658,119 crore. Consequently, the revenue deficit is estimated at Rs.55,184 crore, which amounts to 1.0 per cent of GDP. The fiscal deficit is estimated at Rs.133,287 crore which is 2.5 per cent of GDP. Honourable Members will note that not only will I achieve the target for fiscal deficit under the FRBM Act, I have also left for myself some headroom. In the case of revenue deficit, I will meet the target of annual reduction of 0.5 per cent. However, because of the conscious shift in expenditure in favour of health, education and the social sector, we may need one more year to eliminate the revenue deficit. In my view, this is an entirely acceptable deferment.",,,,,

2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,"122. I acknowledge that significant liabilities of the Government on account of oil, food and fertilizer bonds are currently below the line. This accounting arrangement is consistent with past practice. Nevertheless, our fiscal and revenue deficits are understated to that extent. There is a need to bring these liabilities into our fiscal accounting. As a first step, I have shown these liabilities clearly in 'Budget at a Glance'. After the obligations on account of the Sixth Central Pay Commission become clear, I intend to request the Thirteenth Finance Commission to revisit the roadmap for fiscal adjustment and suggest a suitably revised roadmap.",,,,,

2008-09,P. Chidambaram,"123. Mr. Speaker, I shall now present my tax proposals.",,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,"124. Many people are surprised by the buoyancy in tax revenues, especially in direct taxes. I am not. I have always maintained that moderate and stable tax rates coupled with a tax administration that shows no fear or favour will bring high revenues to the exchequer.",,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,"125. The UPA Government inherited a tax to GDP ratio of 9.2 per cent in 2003-04. At the end of 2007-08, that ratio would have risen to 12.5 per cent.",,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,"126. High growth rates have helped. Changes in attitude have also helped. Above all, information systems and technology have helped most. And, if I may add in a lighter vein, having a lucky Finance Minister may have also helped! We are on course to achieve the Budget Estimates of indirect taxes and exceed the Budget Estimates of direct taxes. I take this opportunity to thank all tax payers and I promise them an efficient and tax payer-friendly administration.",,,,,

2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,"128. The peak rate for non-agricultural products was 20 per cent in January 2004 and now stands at 10 per cent. The collection rate is the closest approximation to the level of protection to domestic industry, and that rate for all imports stood at 10 per cent in 2006-07. Since April 2007, the Rupee has appreciated against the Dollar by 9.8 per cent. Consequently, the case for reducing the peak rate at this stage is very weak. Hence, I propose to make no change in the peak rate of customs duty.",,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,"129. However, I find that in some cases it is necessary to reduce the customs duty in order to provide a fillip to that industry or to promote value addition or to remove inversion or any other anomaly. I shall refer to a few such cases.",,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,,,,,,
2008-09,P. Chidambaram,"130. I propose to reduce the customs duty on Project Imports from 7.5 per cent to 5 per cent. However, I also propose to impose the 4 per cent special CVD on a few specified projects in the power sector.",,,,,

Further, the levy of STT, in the case of options, will be only on the option premium where the option is not exercised, and the liability will be on the seller. In a case where the option is exercised, the levy will be on the settlement price and the liability will be on the buyer. There will be no change in the present rates.",,,,,

2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,Overview of the Economy,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"10.       Madam Speaker, at the time of the presentation of the Interim Budget, I had given a detailed analysis of the economic situation. Without repeating myself, I would like to highlight that the development course charted by the UPA Government in the last five years has been possible due to a step up in the growth rate of the economy and improved revenue buoyancy. The principal growth driver in this period has been private investment, which has been predominantly funded by domestic resources. During the year 2008-09, there has been a dip in the growth rate of GDP from an average of over 9 per cent in the previous three fiscal years to 6.7 per cent. It has affected the pace of job creation in certain sectors of the economy and the investment sentiments of the business community. It has also resulted in considerably lower revenue growth for the government. Another feature of the year 2008-09 was a sharp rise in the wholesale price index to nearly 13% in August 2008 and an equally sharp fall close to 0% in March 2009. While a detailed analysis of the developments has been presented in the Economic Survey-2008-09, tabled in both houses of Parliament last Thursday, I draw your attention to a few aspects.",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"11.       The structure of India ’s economy has changed rapidly in the last ten years. External trade and external capital flows are an important part of the economy and so is the contribution of the services sector to the GDP at well over 50 per cent. The share of merchandise trade (exports plus imports) as a proportion of GDP has more than doubled over the past decade to 38.9 per cent in 2008-09. Similarly, trade in goods and services taken together has also doubled to 47 per cent during this period. Gross capital flows rose to a peak of over 9 per cent of GDP in 2007-08 before falling in the wake of the global financial crisis. The significant increase in the inflow of foreign capital is important, not so much for bridging the domestic savings-investment gap, but for facilitating the intermediation of financial resources to meet the growing needs of the economy.",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"12.       This growing integration of the Indian economy with the rest of the world has brought new opportunities and also new challenges. It has made the task of sustaining high growth more complex. Over the past month, we have critically evaluated Government’s efforts at both short term economic recovery as well as medium term economic growth. The economic recovery and growth is a cooperative effort of the Central and State Governments. That is why, for the first time, I held a meeting with Finance Ministers of States as part of the preparations for this Budget. I intend to make this an annual feature. ",,,,,

2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,Short-term measures,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"13.       To counter the negative fallout of the global slowdown on the Indian economy, the Government responded by providing three focused fiscal stimulus packages in the form of tax relief to boost demand and increased expenditure on public projects to create employment and public assets. The RBI took a number of monetary easing and liquidity enhancing measures to facilitate flow of funds from the financial system to meet the needs of productive sectors.",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"14.       This fiscal accommodation led to an increase in fiscal deficit from 2.7 per cent in 2007-08 to 6.2 per cent of GDP in 2008-09. The difference between the actuals of 2007-08 and 2008-09 constituted the total fiscal stimulus. This fiscal stimulus at 3.5% of GDP at current market prices for 2008-09 amounts to Rs.1,86,000 crore.",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"15.       These measures were effective in arresting the fall in growth rate of GDP in 2008-09 and we achieved a growth of 6.7 per cent. There are signs of revival in the domestic industry and the foreign investors have also returned to the Indian market in the last couple of months. It is possible that the two worst quarters since the global financial meltdown in September 2008 are behind us. While the global financial conditions have shown improvement over the recent months, uncertainties relating to the revival of the global economy remain. We cannot, therefore, afford to drop our guard. We have to continue our efforts to provide further stimulus to the economy.",,,,,

We will ensure that IIFCL is given greater flexibility to aggressively fulfil its mandate.",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"18.       ‘Takeout financing’ is an accepted international practice of releasing long term funds for financing infrastructure projects.  It can be used to effectively address the asset liability mismatch of commercial banks arising out of financing infrastructure projects and also to free up capital for financing new projects. IIFCL would, in consultation with banks, evolve a ‘takeout financing’ scheme which could facilitate incremental lending to the infrastructure sector.",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"19.       Government has had some success in attracting private investment in a wide range of infrastructure sectors such as telecommunications, power generation, airports, ports, roads and even in railways through public private partnerships ( PPP ). To ensure that infrastructure projects do not face financing difficulties arising from the current downturn, as I indicated in my Interim Budget Speech, the Government has decided that IIFCL will refinance 60 per cent of commercial bank loans for PPP projects in critical sectors over the next fifteen to eighteen months. The IIFCL and Banks are now in a position to support projects involving a total investment of Rs.100 thousand crore in infrastructure.  Combined with the steps we are taking to increase public investment in infrastructure, this will provide a big boost to such investment.",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"20.       The investment in infrastructure for the growth of economy is critical.  I have urged my colleagues in the Central and State Governments to remove policy, regulatory and institutional bottlenecks for speedy implementation of infrastructure projects.  I, on my part, will ensure that sufficient funds are made available for this sector.",,,,,

In recognition of the role of JNNURM, the allocation for this scheme is being stepped up by 87 per cent to Rs.12,887 crore in the current budget. To improve the lot of the urban poor, I propose to enhance the allocation for housing and provision of basic amenities to urban poor to Rs.3,973 crore in the current year’s budget.

Agriculture credit flow was Rs.2,87,000 crore  in 2008-09.  The target for agriculture credit flow for the year 2009-10 is being set at Rs.3,25,000 crore. To achieve this, I propose to continue the interest subvention scheme for short term crop loans to farmers for loans upto Rs.3 lakh per farmer at the interest rate of 7 per cent per annum.  I am also happy to announce that, for this year, the Government shall pay an additional subvention of 1 per cent as an incentive to those farmers who repay their short term crop loans on schedule. Thus, the interest rate for these farmers will come down to 6 per cent per annum.  For this, I am making an additional Budget provision of Rs.411 crore over Interim BE.",,,,,

2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"34.       In the context of the nation’s food security, the declining response of agricultural productivity to increased fertilizer usage in the country is a matter of concern.  To ensure balanced application of fertilizers, the Government intends to move towards a nutrient based subsidy regime instead of the current product pricing regime.  It will lead to availability of innovative fertilizer products in the market at reasonable prices.  This unshackling of the fertilizer manufacturing sector is expected to attract fresh investments in this sector. In due course it is also intended to move to a system of direct transfer of subsidy to the farmers.",,,,,

2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,Petroleum and Diesel pricing policy,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"35.       Madam Speaker, Honourable Members are aware that global prices of oil and petroleum products had shot up to unprecedented levels in 2008-09. Most oil importing countries, including our neighbours, adjusted their domestic prices to reflect these global changes. Though prices have declined since then, they are already about double of the lows reached in the wake of the global financial crisis. It is important to recognise that, with almost three-quarters of our oil consumption met through imports, domestic prices of petrol and diesel have to be broadly in sync with global prices of these items. Government will set up an expert group to advise on a viable and sustainable system of pricing petroleum products. Details will be announced by my colleague, the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas.",,,,,

2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,Taxation,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"36.       It is time that we complete the process that was started in 1991 for building a trust based, simple, neutral, tax system with almost no exemptions and low rates designed to promote voluntary compliance. The Income Tax Return Forms should be simple and user-friendly. I have asked the Department to work on SARAL-II forms for early introduction. We need a tax system which generates revenues on a sustained basis without use of coercive tax collection methods at the end of each year to meet targets. It is my intention to make a modest start in this direction in the current year and ensure that the process is completed in the next four years. At the end of this process, I hope the Finance Minister can credibly say that our tax collectors are like honey bees collecting nectar from the flowers without disturbing them, but spreading their pollen so that all flowers can thrive and bear fruit.",,,,,

2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"37.       The Public Sector Undertakings are the wealth of the nation, and part of this wealth should rest in the hands of the people. While retaining at least 51 per cent Government equity in our enterprises, I propose to encourage people’s participation in our disinvestment programme. Here, I must state clearly that public sector enterprises such as banks and insurance companies will remain in the public sector and will be given all support, including capital infusion, to grow and remain competitive.",,,,,

2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,Financial sector,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"38.       The financial sector is the life blood of any economy. Our Government’s approach to the banking and financial sector has been to ensure robust oversight and regulation while expanding financial access and deepening markets. The merit of this balanced approach has been borne out in the recent experience, as the turbulence in the world financial markets has left the Indian banking and financial sector relatively unaffected. Never before has Indira Gandhi’s bold decision to nationalise our banking system exactly 40 years ago - on 14th of July, 1969 - appeared as wise and visionary as it has over the past few months. Her approach continues to be our inspiration even as we introduce competition and new technology in this sector.",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"39.       The average public float in Indian listed companies is less than 15 per cent.  Deep non-manipulable markets require larger and diversified public shareholdings.  This requirement should be uniformly applied to the private sector as well as listed public sector companies.  I propose to raise, in a phased manner, the threshold for non-promoter public shareholding for all listed companies.",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"40.       For a country like ours, with significant sections of unbanked population and regions, financial inclusion is vital for sustaining long term equitable development. As part of the financial inclusion drive, scheduled commercial banks have been opening ‘no frills’ accounts either with ‘nil’ or very low minimum balances. So far, these banks have opened 3.3 crore such accounts. The RBI has announced a further relaxation in its Branch Authorisation Policy. Scheduled Commercial Banks are now allowed to set up off-site ATMs without prior approval, subject to reporting. ",,,,,

2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"41.       Despite the expansion of banking network in the country, there are still some areas that remain under-banked or unbanked.  A sub-committee of State Level Bankers Committee ( SLB C) will identify such areas and formulate an action plan for providing banking facilities to all these areas in the next 3 years.  I propose to set aside Rs.100 crore during the current year as one-time grant-in-aid to ensure provision of at least one centre/Point of Sales (POS) for banking services in each of the unbanked blocks in the country.",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"42.       The Government has established Competition Commission of India, an autonomous regulatory body to promote and sustain competition in markets, protect interests of consumers and to prevent practices having adverse effect on competition.

2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,

Our Government is committed to creating a facilitating environment in which a competitive private sector can thrive and play its rightful role in nation’s economic development. India ’s high growth of 8.5% per annum from 2004 to 2008 was fuelled in very large part by private investment.

During 2008-09, NREGA provided employment opportunities for more than 4.47 crore households as against 3.39 crore households covered in 2007-08. We are committed to providing a real wage of Rs.100 a day as an entitlement under the NREGA. To increase the productivity of assets and resources under NREGA, convergence with other schemes relating to agriculture, forests, water resources, land resources and rural roads is being initiated. In the first stage, a total of 115 pilot districts have been selected for such convergence.  Details of these measures and convergence guidelines will be announced by my colleague, the Minister of Rural Development.

2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"75.       The increase in Non Plan expenditure is mainly on account of the implementation of the Sixth Central Pay Commission recommendations, increased food subsidy and higher interest payment arising out of the larger fiscal deficit in 2008-09.

Against the backdrop of limited fiscal space because of reduction in CENVAT and Service Tax rates, Government have taken a conscious and bold decision to enhance the Gross Budgetary Support (GBS) for the Annual Plan 2009-10 by Rs.40,000 crore over Interim Budget 2009-10. Bulk of this enhanced GBS is directed towards public investment in infrastructure with special emphasis on rural infrastructure, raising growth potential and leading to income generation. Besides, the State Governments will be permitted to borrow additional 0.5% of their GSDP by relaxing the fiscal deficit target under FRBM from 3.5% to 4% of their GSDP. This will enable the State Governments to raise additional open market loans of about Rs.21,000 crore in the current year. In other words, the total additionality in Plan expenditure by Centre and the States put together would be Rs.61,000 crore over Interim Budget. I do believe that this fiscal expansion will go a long way in reversing the impact of economic slowdown and accelerate our growth revival in the medium term.",,,,,

2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"77.       Madam Speaker, given the possibility of the economic downturn persisting in the current year, the gross tax receipts are budgeted at Rs.6,41,079 crore  in  BE 2009-10, compared to Rs.6,87,715 crore in BE 2008-09.  The non tax revenue receipts are, however, likely to be better and are estimated at Rs.1,40,279 crore in BE 2009-10 compared to Rs.95,785 crore in BE 2008-09.  The revenue deficit as a percentage of GDP is projected at 4.8% compared to 1% in BE 2008-09 and 4.6% as per provisional accounts of 2008-09. The fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP is projected at 6.8% compared to 2.5% in BE 2008-09 and 6.2% as per provisional accounts 2008-09. This level of deficit is a matter of concern and Government will address this issue in right earnest to come back to the path of fiscal consolidation at the earliest.",,,,,

He said and I quote, “Just as one plucks fruits from a garden as they ripen, so shall a King have revenue collected as it becomes due. Just as one does not collect unripe fruits, he shall avoid taking wealth that is not due because that will make the people angry and spoil the very sources of revenue.”",,,,,

2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"80.       As the House is aware, the thrust of reforms over the last few years, including the previous term of this Government, has been to improve the efficiency and equity of our tax system. This is sought to be achieved by eliminating distortions in the tax structure, introducing moderate levels of taxation and expanding the base. These policy changes have been accompanied by requisite re-engineering of key business processes coupled with automation, both for direct and indirect taxes. On the direct tax side, a recent initiative for further improving efficiency is the setting up of a Centralized Processing Centre (CPC) at Bengaluru where all electronically filed returns, and paper returns filed in entire Karnataka, will be processed.",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"81.       These tax reform initiatives have produced impressive results. The Centre’s Tax- GDP ratio has increased to 11.5 per cent in 2008-09 from a low of 9.2 per cent in 2003-04.  The healthy growth in tax revenues over the last five years is essentially attributable to growth in direct taxes. Further, the share of direct taxes in the Centre’s tax revenues has increased to 56 per cent in 2008-09 from 41 per cent in 2003-04, reflecting a sharp improvement in the equity of our tax system.   The Government is committed to furthering this process of tax reform.   ",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"82.       In the course of preparation of this budget, I have had the opportunity to interact with large number of stakeholders and receive valuable inputs.  Most suggestions were for structural changes in the tax system.  Tax reform, like all reforms, is a process and not an event.  Therefore, I propose to pursue structural changes in direct taxes by releasing the new Direct Taxes Code within the next 45 days and in indirect taxes by accelerating the process for the smooth introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) with effect from 1st April, 2010 . ",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"83.       The Direct Taxes Code, along with a Discussion Paper, will be released to the public for debate.  Based on the inputs received, the Government will finalise the Direct Taxes Code Bill for introduction in this House sometime during the Winter Session. ",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"84.       To further enhance efficiency in tax administration, I intend to merge the two Authorities for Advance Rulings on Direct and Indirect Taxes by amending the relevant Acts. This will enable the Authority for Advance Rulings set up under Section 245-O of the Income Tax Act, 1961 to also function as the Authority for Advance Rulings for Indirect Taxes.",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"85.       I have been informed that the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers has made considerable progress in preparing the roadmap and the design of the GST. Officials from the Central Government have also been associated in this exercise. I am glad to inform the House that, through their collaborative efforts, they have reached an agreement on the basic structure in keeping with the principles of fiscal federalism enshrined in the Constitution. I compliment the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers for their untiring efforts.  The broad contour of the GST Model is that it will be a dual GST comprising of a Central GST and a State GST.  The Centre and the States will each legislate, levy and administer the Central GST and State GST, respectively. I will reinforce the Central Government’s catalytic role to facilitate the introduction of GST by 1st April, 2010 after due consultations with all stakeholders.",,,,,

2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"87.       Madam Speaker, there have been demands by the corporate sector for reduction in tax rates.  However, tax rates are determined by the size of the tax base; if the tax base is higher, the tax rates can be lower.  The Income Tax Act is riddled with a plethora of tax exemptions which substantially erode the tax base.  The extent of this erosion is presented to this House in the form of a Revenue Foregone Statement.  The growth in the direct tax revenue foregone is relatively higher than the growth in the direct tax revenues.  Accordingly, I do not propose to make any change in the Corporate Tax rates.",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"88.       With a view to providing interim relief to small and marginal taxpayers and senior citizens, I propose to increase the personal income tax exemption limit by Rs.15,000 from Rs.2.25 lakh to Rs.2.40 lakh for senior citizens. Similarly I also propose to raise the exemption limit by Rs.10,000 from Rs.1.80 lakh to Rs.1.90 lakh for women tax payers and by Rs.10,000 from Rs.1.50 lakh to Rs.1.60 lakh for all other categories of individual taxpayers.  Further, I also propose to increase the deduction under section 80-DD in respect of maintenance, including medical treatment, of a dependent who is a person with severe disability to Rs.1 lakh from the present limit of Rs.75,000. ",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"89.       In the past, surcharges on direct taxes have generally been levied to meet the revenue needs arising from natural calamities.  The Government has set up the National Calamity Contingency Fund to build up resources to meet emergency situations.  As a corollary, surcharge on direct taxes should be removed.  However, this has to be balanced with the revenue needs of the Government.  Therefore, in the first instance, I propose to phase out the surcharge on various direct taxes by eliminating the surcharge of 10 per cent on personal income tax.",,,,,

The deduction under these sections would not be available beyond the financial year 2009-2010.

2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"91.       The Finance Act, 2005 introduced the Fringe Benefit Tax on the value of certain fringe benefits provided by employers to their employees.

2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"93.       Under the present scheme of the Income Tax Act, tax exemptions are largely profit-linked.  Such incentives are inherently inefficient and liable to misuse.  Therefore, it is proposed to incentivise businesses by providing investment-linked tax exemptions.  To begin with, I propose to extend investment- linked tax incentives to the businesses of setting up and operating ‘cold chain’, warehousing facilities for storing agricultural produce and the business of laying and operating cross country natural gas or crude or petroleum oil pipeline network for distribution on common carrier principle.  Under this method, all capital expenditure, other than expenditure on land, goodwill and financial instruments will be fully allowable as deduction.",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"94.       Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) was introduced to address inequity in taxation of corporate taxpayers. In the quest for greater equity, I propose to increase the rate of MAT to 15 per cent of book profits from the present rate of 10 per cent. However, to grant relief to corporate taxpayers, I also propose to extend the period allowed to carry forward the tax credit under MAT from seven years to ten years.",,,,,

While the NPS will continue to be subjected to the Exempt-Exempt-Taxed (EET) method of tax treatment of savings, it is proposed to provide necessary fiscal support to the NPS for the establishment of this much needed social security system. Accordingly, I propose to exempt the income of the NPS Trust from income tax and any dividend paid to this Trust from Dividend Distribution Tax.  Similarly, all purchase and sale of equity shares and derivatives by the NPS Trust will also be exempt from the Securities Transaction Tax. I also propose to enable self employed persons to participate in the NPS and avail of the tax benefits available thereto.",,,,,

2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"96.       In order to further improve the investment climate in the country, we need to facilitate the resolution of tax disputes faced by foreign companies within a reasonable time frame.  This is particularly relevant for such companies in the Information Technology (IT) sector. I, therefore, propose to create an alternative dispute resolution mechanism within the Income Tax Department for the resolution of transfer pricing disputes. To reduce the impact of judgemental errors in determining transfer price in international transactions, it is proposed to empower the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to formulate ‘safe harbour’ rules.",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"97.       The Finance Act, 2008 introduced the Commodity Transaction Tax (CTT) to be levied on taxable commodities transactions entered in a recognized association.

With a view to reforming the system of funding of political parties, I propose to provide that donations to electoral trusts shall be allowed as a 100 per cent deduction in the computation of the income of the donor.  For this purpose, Electoral Trusts will be such trusts as are set up as pass-through vehicles for routing the donations to political parties and are approved by CBDT.",,,,,

2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"100.     Anonymous donations to charitable institutions are presently liable to tax so as to prevent unaccounted money being routed to such entities in the garb of anonymous donations. However, some organisations are facing genuine problems in complying with the procedural requirements.  In order to mitigate the practical difficulties being faced by such charitable organisations, I propose to grant relief to such organisations by not taxing anonymous donations received to the extent of 5 per cent of their total income or a sum of Rs.1 lakh, whichever is higher.",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"101.     To facilitate the business operations of all small taxpayers and reduce their compliance burden, I propose to expand the scope of presumptive taxation to all small businesses with a turnover upto Rs.40 lakh. All such taxpayers will have the option to declare their income from business at the rate of 8 per cent of their turnover and simultaneously enjoy exemption from the compliance burden of maintaining books of accounts.  As a procedural simplification, I also propose to allow them to pay their entire tax liability from business at the time of filing their return by exempting them from paying advance tax.  This new scheme will come into effect from the financial year 2010-11.",,,,,

2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"102.     Madam Speaker, in the context of the geo-political environment, it is necessary for us to create our own facilities for energy security.  Accordingly, I propose to extend the tax holiday under section 80-IB(9) of the Income Tax Act, which was hitherto available in respect of profits arising from the commercial production or refining of mineral oil, also to natural gas.  This tax benefit will be available to undertakings in respect of profits derived from the commercial production of mineral oil and natural gas from oil and gas blocks which are awarded under the New Exploration Licensing Policy-VIII round of bidding. Further, I also propose to retrospectively amend the provisions of the said section to provide that “undertaking” for the purposes of section 80-IB(9) will mean all blocks awarded in any single contract.",,,,,

2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"106.     Although our domestic industry has weathered the impact of the global financial crisis and the resultant slowdown with resilience, it is yet to fully find its feet. Manufacturing growth, which had turned negative in October 2008 on a year-on-year basis and remained in that zone till March this year, appears to be barely turning the corner. However, the global scenario remains worrisome and it is my view that the paramount need is to provide industry with a stable framework. My proposals on indirect taxes seek to achieve this by maintaining the overall rate structure for customs and central excise duties as well as service tax. I must hasten to add that I have not hesitated to act where distortions provide a compelling reason or where relief would provide a healing touch.",,,,,

These rates were fixed in 2004 and have not been reviewed even as the price of gold has increased manifold. I propose to partially restore the incidence by increasing these rates to Rs.200 per ten grams and Rs.500 per ten grams respectively. Along the same lines, the customs duty on silver (excluding jewellery) will be increased from Rs.500 per kg to Rs.1,000 per kg.

2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"116.     Hon’ble Members are aware that the Government announced a series of fiscal stimulus packages, one of the key elements of which was the sharp reduction in the ad valorem rates of Central Excise duty for non-petroleum products by 4 percentage points across the board on 7th of December 2008 and by another 2 percentage points in the mean CENVAT rate on the 24th of February, 2009.",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,117.     One of the consequences of these cuts was that pure cotton textiles came to be fully exempted from excise duty. We have received representations that full exemption prevents manufacturers from availing of export rebate of the duty paid from CENVAT credit. I propose to rectify this situation by restoring the erstwhile optional rate of 4 per cent for cotton textiles beyond the fibre stage.,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"118.     Ever since the revamp of the excise duty structure on textiles by my distinguished predecessor in the 2004 budget, a differential in rates has been maintained between the cotton sector and the manmade sector. In keeping with the integrity of the earlier structure, I propose to restore the rate of 8 per cent Central Excise duty on manmade fibre and yarn on a mandatory basis and on stages beyond fibre and yarn at that rate on optional basis. These changes, together with duty changes on intermediates, would imply that the duty on all types of manmade fibre and yarn and their intermediates would be the same, easing the problem of credit accumulation.",,,,,

2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"131.     The Export Promotion Councils and the Federation of Indian Export Organizations (FIEO) provide a valuable service in augmenting our export effort.  I propose  to exempt them from the levy of service tax on the membership and other fees collected by them till 31st March, 2010 . ",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"132.     In the goods transport sector, service tax is currently levied on transport of goods by road, by air, through pipelines and in containers.  However, goods carried by Indian railways or those carried as coastal cargo or through inland waterways are not charged to service tax.   In order to provide a level playing field in the goods transport sector, I propose to extend the levy of service tax to these modes of goods transport.  The new levy is not likely to impact the prices of essential commodities or goods for mass consumption, as suitable exemptions would be provided.",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"133.     As the Hon’ble Members are aware, services provided by chartered accountants, cost accountants, and company secretaries as well as by engineering and management consultants are presently charged to service tax.  Although there is a school of thought that legal consultants do not provide any service to their client, I hold my distinguished predecessor in high esteem and disagree!  As such, I propose to extend service tax on advice, consultancy or technical assistance provided in the field of law.  This tax would not be applicable in case the service provider or the service receiver is an individual.",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"134.     Vehicles having ‘Stage Carriage Permits’ and run by State undertakings are exempted from service tax. However, transportation of passengers undertaken by private enterprises in vehicles having ‘Contract Carriage Permits’ is, subjected to service tax.  In order to bring parity in tax treatment, I propose to exempt such transportation also from the levy of service tax.",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"135.     In July, 2008 goods transport agents (GTA) went on strike with several demands.  One of the demands that was accepted by the government was to exempt certain services, such as packing, cargo handling and warehousing, provided to GTAs en route, from service tax.  For this purpose an exemption notification was issued. It was also demanded by goods transport agents that the proceedings already initiated against such service providers should be dropped.  The Government has accepted this genuine demand. Therefore, I propose to make certain legislative changes required to fulfill this promise.",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,

2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,CONCLUSION,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"138.     As we begin this five year journey, the road ahead will not be easy. We will have to manage uncertainties and there will be as many problems as there would be solutions.  Mahatma Gandhi said and I quote, “Democracy is the art and science of mobilizing the entire physical, economic and spiritual resources of various sections of the people in the service of the common good of all.” This is precisely what we will have to do. With strong hearts, enlightened minds and willing hands, we will have to overcome all odds and remove all obstacles to create a brave new India of our dreams.",,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2009-10,Pranab Mukherjee,"139.     Madam Speaker, with these words I commend the budget to the House",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"Madam Speaker,",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,            I rise to present the Union Budget for 2010-11.,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"            In 2009, when I presented the interim Budget in February and the regular Budget in July in this august House, the Indian economy was facing grave uncertainties. Growth had started decelerating and the business sentiment was weak. The economy's capacity to sustain high growth was under serious threat from the widespread economic slowdown in the developed world.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"2.          It was not clear to us, as also to the policy makers in many other countries, how this crisis would eventually unfold. What would be its impact on the growth momentum of the Indian economy?  How soon will we be able to turnaround the fortunes of our economy? The short term global outlook was bleak and the consensus was that year 2009 would face the brunt of this crisis across the world.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"3.          At home, there was added uncertainty on account of the delayed and sub-normal south-west monsoon, which had undermined the kharif crop in the country.  There were concerns about production and prices of food items and its possible repercussions on the growth of rural demand.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"4.          Today, as I stand before you, I can say with confidence that we have weathered these crises well. Indian economy now is in a far better position than it was a year ago. That is not to say that the challenges today are any less than what they were nine months ago when UPA under the leadership of Mrs Sonia Gandhi was elected back to power and Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh formed the Government for the second term.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"5.          The three challenges and the medium term perspective that I had outlined in my last Budget Speech remain relevant, even today. These would continue to engage the Indian policy-planners for the next few years.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"6.          The first challenge before us is to quickly revert to the high GDP growth path of 9 per cent and then find the means to cross the 'double digit growth barrier'. This calls for imparting a fresh momentum to the impressive recovery in growth witnessed in the past few months. In this endeavour, I seek Lord Indra's help to make the recovery more broad-based in the coming months.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"7.          Growth is only as important as what it enables us to do and be. Therefore, the second challenge is to harness economic growth to consolidate the recent gains in making development more inclusive. The thrust imparted to the development of infrastructure in rural areas has to be pursued to achieve the desired objectives within a fixed time frame.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"8.          We have to strengthen food security, improve education opportunities and provide health facilities at the level of households, both in rural and urban areas. These are issues that require significant resources, and we have to find those resources.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"9.          The third challenge relates to the weaknesses in government systems, structures and institutions at different levels of governance. Indeed, in the coming years, if there is one factor that can hold us back in realising our potential as a modern nation, it is the bottleneck of our public delivery mechanisms. There have been many initiatives in this regard, in different sectors, at different points of time. Some of them have been effective in reforming the way the Government works in those areas. But we have a long way to go before we can rest on this count.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,10.        The Union Budget cannot be a mere statement of Government accounts. It has to reflect the Government's vision and signal the policies to come in future.,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"11.        With development and economic reforms, the focus of economic activity has shifted towards the non-governmental actors, bringing into sharper focus the role of Government as an enabler.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,12.        An enabling Government does not try to deliver directly to the citizens everything that they need. Instead it creates an enabling ethos so that individual enterprise and creativity can flourish. Government concentrates on supporting and delivering services to the disadvantaged sections of the society.,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,13.        It is this broad conceptualisation of the Budget that informs my speech today. I would now begin by presenting a brief overview of the economy.,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,Overview of the Economy,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"14.        Yesterday, I laid on the table of the House the Economic Survey, which gives a detailed analysis of the economic situation of the country over the past twelve months.  I intend to highlight only a few salient features that form the backdrop of this Budget.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"15.        The fiscal year 2009-10 was a challenging year for the Indian economy. The significant deceleration in the second half of 2008-09, brought the real GDP growth down to 6.7 per cent, from an average of over 9 per cent in the preceding three years. We were among the first few countries in the world to implement a broad-based counter-cyclic policy package to respond to the negative fallout of the global slowdown. It included a substantial fiscal expansion along with liberal monetary policy support.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"16.        The effectiveness of these policy measures became evident with fast paced recovery. The economy stabilised in the first quarter of 2009-10 itself, when it clocked a GDP growth of 6.1 per cent, as against 5.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of the preceding year. It registered a strong rebound in the second quarter, when the growth rate rose to 7.9 per cent. With the Advance Estimates placing the likely growth for 2009-10 at 7.2 per cent, we are indeed vindicated in our policy stand. The final figure may well turn out to be higher when the third and fourth quarter GDP estimates for 2009-10 become available.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"17.        This recovery is very encouraging for it has come about despite a negative growth in the agriculture sector.  More importantly, it is the result of a renewed momentum in the manufacturing sector and marks the rise of this sector as the growth driver of the economy. The growth rate in manufacturing in December 2009 was 18.5 per cent— the highest in the past two decades. There are also signs of a turnaround in the merchandise exports with a positive growth in November and December 2009 after a decline of about twelve successive months. Export figures for January are also encouraging.  Significant private investment can now be expected to provide the engine for sustaining a growth of 9 per cent per annum. With some luck, I hope to breach the 10 per cent mark in not-too-distant a future.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"18.        A major concern during the second half of 2009-10 has been the emergence of double digit food inflation. There was a momentum in food prices since the flare-up of global commodity prices preceding the financial crisis in 2008, but it was expected that the agriculture season beginning June 2009 would help in moderating the food inflation. However, the erratic monsoons and drought like conditions in large parts of the country reinforced the supply side bottlenecks in some of the essential commodities. This set in motion inflationary expectations. Since December 2009, there have been indications of these high food prices, together with the gradual hardening of the fuel product prices, getting transmitted to other non-food items as well. The inflation data for January seems to have confirmed this trend.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"19.        Government is acutely conscious of this situation and has set in motion steps, in consultation with the State chief ministers, which should bring down the inflation in the next few months and ensure that there is better management of food security in the country.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,CONSOLIDATING  GROWTH,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"20.       Managing a complex economy is a difficult task, more so when it is a growing economy in a globalised world. And yet, choices have to be made and they have to be well-timed.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"21.        After successfully managing the effects of the global slowdown, we need to strengthen the domestic macroeconomic environment to help consolidate the rebound in growth and sustain it over the medium term. We need to review the stimulus imparted to the economy and move towards the preferred path of fiscal consolidation that facilitated the remarkable growth in the pre-crisis five year period.  We need to make growth more broad-based and ensure that supply-demand imbalances are better managed.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,Fiscal Consolidation,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"22.        The success of the fiscal stimulus in supporting domestic demand could be traced to its composition. The approach of the Government was to increase the disposable income in the hands of the people by effecting reductions in indirect taxes and by expanding public expenditure on programmes like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and rural infrastructure. Now that the recovery has taken root, there is a need to review public spending, mobilise resources and gear them towards building the productivity of the economy.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"23.        In shaping the fiscal policy for 2010-11, I have acted on the recommendations of the Thirteenth Finance Commission. It has recommended a calibrated exit strategy from the expansionary fiscal stance of last two years. The Commission has recommended a capping of the combined debt of the Centre and the States at 68 per cent of the GDP to be achieved by 2014-15.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"24.        As a part of the fiscal consolidation process, it would be for the first time that the Government would target an explicit reduction in its domestic public debt-GDP ratio. I intend to bring out, within six months, a status paper giving a detailed analysis of the situation and a road map for curtailing the overall public debt. This would be followed by an annual report on the subject.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,Tax reforms,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"25.        I am happy to inform the Honourable Members that the process for building a simple tax system with minimum exemptions and low rates designed to promote voluntary compliance, is now nearing completion. On the Direct Tax Code the wide-ranging discussions with stakeholders have been concluded.  I am confident that the Government will be in a position to implement the Direct Tax Code from April 1, 2011.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"26.        On Goods and Services Tax, we have been focusing on generating a wide consensus on its design. In November, 2009 the Empowered Committee of the State Finance Ministers placed the first discussion paper on GST in the public domain. The Thirteenth Finance Commission has also made a number of significant recommendations relating to GST, which will contribute to the ongoing discussions. We are actively engaged with the Empowered Committee to finalise the structure of GST as well as the modalities of its expeditious implementation. It will be my earnest endeavour to introduce GST along with the DTC in April, 2011.",,,,,

2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"27.        While presenting the Budget for 2009-10, I invited people to participate in Government's disinvestment programme to share in the wealth and prosperity of the Central Public Sector Undertakings.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"28.        Since then, ownership has been broad based in Oil India Limited, NHPC, NTPC and Rural Electrification Corporation while the process is on for National Mineral Development Corporation and Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam. The Government will raise about Rs.25,000 crore during the current year. Through this process, I propose to raise a higher amount during the year 2010-11. The proceeds will be utilised to meet the capital expenditure requirements of social sector schemes for creating new assets.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"29.        Listing of Central Public Sector Undertakings improves corporate governance, besides unlocking the value for all stakeholders—the government, the company and the shareholders. Market capitalization of five companies which have been listed since October, 2004 has increased by 3.8 times from the book value of Rs.78,841 crore to Rs.2,98,929 crore.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,30.        The effective management of public expenditure by bringing it in line with the Government's objectives is a part of the fiscal consolidation process. This calls for proper targeting of subsidies and expenditure adjustment.,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,Fertiliser subsidy,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"31.        I had announced the intent of the Government for the fertiliser sector in my Budget Speech of 2009. A Nutrient Based Subsidy policy for the fertiliser sector has since been approved by the Government and will become effective from April 1, 2010. This policy is expected to promote balanced fertilization through new fortified products and focus on extension services by the fertiliser industry. This will lead to an increase in agricultural productivity and consequently better returns for the farmers. Over time, the policy is expected to reduce volatility in the demand for fertiliser subsidy in addition to containing the subsidy bill. Government will ensure that nutrient based fertiliser prices for transition year 2010-11, will remain around MRPs currently prevailing. The new system will move towards direct transfer of subsidies to the farmers.",,,,,

2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,Petroleum and Diesel pricing policy,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"32.        In the last Budget, the constitution of an Expert Group, to advise the Government on a viable and sustainable system of pricing of petroleum products, was announced.  The Group headed by Shri Kirit Parikh has submitted its recommendations to the Government.  Decision on these recommendations will be taken by my colleague, the Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas, in due course.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"33.        I am very happy to inform the Honourable Members that we have not only adhered to the fiscal roadmap that I had presented as a part of the Budget documents last year, but we have improved upon it. Except for meeting the liabilities of the year 2008-09, we have not issued oil or fertiliser bonds. I shall come to the numbers when I refer to the budget estimates a little later.",,,,,

2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,Foreign Direct Investment,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"34.        Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows during the year have been steady in spite of the decline in global capital flows. India received FDI equity inflows of US$ 20.9 billion during April-December, 2009 compared to US$ 21.1 billion during the same period last year.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"35.        Government has taken a number of steps to simplify the FDI regime to make it easily comprehensible to foreign investors. For the first time, both ownership and control have been recognised as central to the FDI policy, and methodology for calculation of indirect foreign investment in Indian companies has been clearly defined. A consistent policy on downstream investment has also been formulated. Another major initiative has been the complete liberalization of pricing and payment of technology transfer fee, trademark, brand name and royalty payments. These payments can now be made under the automatic route.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,36.        Government also intends to make the FDI policy user-friendly by consolidating all prior regulations and guidelines into one comprehensive document. This would enhance clarity and predictability of our FDI policy to foreign investors.,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,Financial Stability and Development Council,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"37.        The financial crisis of 2008-09 has fundamentally changed the structure of banking and financial markets the world over. With a view to strengthen and institutionalise the mechanism for maintaining financial stability, Government has decided to setup an apex-level Financial Stability and Development Council. Without prejudice to the autonomy of regulators, this Council would monitor macro prudential supervision of the economy, including the functioning of large financial conglomerates, and address inter-regulatory coordination issues. It will also focus on financial literacy and financial inclusion.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,Banking Licences,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"38.        The Indian banking system has emerged unscathed from the crisis. We need to ensure that the banking system grows in size and sophistication to meet the needs of a modern economy. Besides, there is a need to extend the geographic coverage of banks and improve access to banking services. In this context, I am happy to inform the Honourable Members that the RBI is considering giving some additional banking licenses to private sector players. Non Banking Financial Companies could also be considered, if they meet the RBI's eligibility criteria.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,Public Sector Bank Capitalisation,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"39.        During 2008-09, the Government infused Rs.1900 crore as Tier-I capital in four public sector banks to maintain a comfortable level of Capital to Risk Weighted Asset Ratio. An additional sum of Rs.1200 crore is being infused now. For the year 2010-11, I propose to provide a sum of Rs.16,500 crore to ensure that the Public Sector Banks are able to attain a minimum 8 per cent Tier-I capital by March 31, 2011.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,Recapitalisation of Regional Rural Banks,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"40.        Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) play an important role in providing credit to rural economy. The capital of these banks is shared by the Central Government, sponsor banks and State Governments. The banks were last capitalised in",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,2006-07. I propose to provide further capital to strengthen the RRBs so that they have adequate capital base to support increased lending to the rural economy.,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,Corporate Governance,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"41.        Improvement in corporate governance and regulation is an important part of the overall investment environment in the country. Government has introduced the Companies Bill, 2009 in the Parliament, which will replace the existing Companies Act, 1956. The proposed new bill will address issues related to regulation in corporate sector in the context of the changing business environment.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,Exports,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"42.        Government has provided interest subvention of 2 per cent on pre-shipment export credit up to March 31, 2010 for exports in certain sectors. I propose to extend the interest subvention of 2 per cent for one more year for exports covering handicrafts, carpets, handlooms and small and medium enterprises.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,Special Economic Zones (SEZs),,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,43.        The SEZs have attracted significant flows of domestic and foreign investments. In first three quarters of 2009-10 exports from SEZs recorded a growth of 127 per cent over the corresponding period last year. Government is committed to ensuring continued growth of SEZs to draw investments and boost exports and employment.,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,Agriculture Growth,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"44.        The agriculture sector occupies centre-stage in our resolve to promote inclusive growth, enhance rural incomes and sustain food security. To spur the growth in this sector, the Government intends to follow a four-pronged strategy covering (a) agricultural production; (b) reduction in wastage of produce;",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,(c) credit support to farmers; and (d) a thrust to the food processing sector.,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"45.        The first element of the strategy is to extend the green revolution to the eastern region of the country comprising Bihar, Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, Eastern UP, West Bengal and Orissa, with the active involvement of Gram Sabhas and the farming families. For the year 2010-11, I propose to provide Rs.400 crore for this initiative.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"46.        In the 60th year of the Republic, it is proposed to organise 60,000 ""pulses and oil seed villages"" in rain-fed areas during 2010-11 and provide an integrated intervention for water harvesting, watershed management and soil health, to enhance the productivity of the dry land farming areas.  I propose to provide Rs.300 crore for this purpose. This initiative will be an integral part of the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"47.        The gains already made in the green revolution areas have to be sustained through conservation farming, which involves concurrent attention to soil health, water conservation and preservation of biodiversity.  I propose an allocation of Rs.200 crore for launching this climate resilient agriculture initiative.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"48.        The second element of the strategy relates to reduction of significant wastages in storage as well as in the operations of the existing food supply chains in the country. This needs to be addressed. As the Prime Minister has said recently, ""We need greater competition and therefore need to take a firm view on opening up of the retail trade.""  It will help in bringing down the considerable difference between the farm gate prices, wholesale prices and retail prices.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,49.        There is wastage of grain procured for buffer stocks and public distribution system due to acute shortage of storage capacity in the Food Corporation of India. This deficit in the storage capacity is met through an ongoing scheme for private sector participation where the FCI has been hiring godowns from private parties for a guaranteed period of 5 years. This period is now being extended to 7 years.,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"50.        The third element of the strategy relates to improving the availability of credit to farmers.   I am happy to inform the honourable Members that banks have been consistently meeting the targets set for agriculture credit flow in the past few years. For the year 2010-11, the target has been raised to Rs.3,75,000 crore from Rs.3,25,000 crore in the current year.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"51.        The Debt Waiver and Debt Relief Scheme for Farmers was a major initiative of the UPA Government.

2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"112.      The Gross Tax Receipts are estimated at Rs.7,46,651 crore. The Non Tax Revenue Receipts are estimated at Rs.1,48,118 crore. The net tax revenue to the Centre as well as the expenditure provisions in 2010-11 have been estimated with reference to the recommendations of the Thirteenth Finance Commission.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"113.      The total expenditure proposed in the Budget Estimates for 2010-11 is Rs.11,08,749 crore, which is an increase of 8.6 per cent over the total expenditure in BE 2009-10.  The Plan and Non Plan expenditures in BE 2010-11 are estimated at Rs.3,73,092 crore and Rs.7,35,657 crore, respectively. While there is a 15 per cent increase in Plan expenditure, the increase in Non Plan expenditure is only 6 per cent over the BE of previous year.  With this level of Plan expenditure, I am confident that the total Plan expenditure would be very close to 100 per cent of the expenditure envisaged in the Eleventh Five Year Plan.",,,,,

In the Medium Term Fiscal Policy Statement presented along with Budget 2009-10, I had laid down a road map for fiscal deficit. I am happy to report that in keeping with my commitment, I have been able to present the Budget for 2010-11 with a fiscal deficit of 5.5 per cent. In the Medium Term Fiscal Policy Statement being presented to the House today, along with other Budget documents, the rolling targets for fiscal deficit are pegged at 4.8 per cent and 4.1 per cent for 2011-12 and 2012-13, respectively.

This marks an improvement of about one per cent in fiscal deficit during the current year.  I have made a conscious effort to avoid issuing bonds to oil and fertiliser companies.  I would like to continue with this practice of extending Government subsidy in cash, thereby bringing all subsidy related liabilities into our fiscal accounting.",,,,,

I have presented the developments in both reform initiatives in Part 'A' of my Speech.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"119.     We have continued on the path of computerisation in core areas of service delivery in the administration of direct taxes.  This will reduce the physical interface between taxpayers and tax administration and speed up procedures and processes. The Centralised Processing Centre at Bengaluru is now fully functional and is processing around 20,000 returns daily. This initiative will be taken forward by setting up two more Centres during the year.",,,,,

2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"121.     To achieve the roll-out of GST by April 2011, the indirect tax administrations at the Centre and the States need to revamp their internal work processes based on the use of Information Technology. I am happy to inform Honorable Members that project ACES - Automation of Central Excise & Service Tax, has already been rolled out throughout the country this year. This will impart greater transparency in tax administration and improve the delivery of taxpayer services. Similarly, a Mission Mode Project for computerisation of Commercial Taxes in States has been approved recently. With an outlay of Rs.1133 crore of which the Centre's share is Rs.800 crore, the project will lay the foundation for the launch of GST.",,,,,

2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,125.     Last year I provided relief to individual taxpayers by enhancing the exemption limit for all taxpayers and withdrawing the surcharge on personal income tax. Taxpayers have responded positively to these concessions by contributing a higher level of taxes.  There is a persuasive case for further relief by broadening the current tax slabs which I propose as follows:,,,,,

2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"127.     To promote savings as well as to ensure their utilisation for the thrust area of infrastructure, I propose to allow a deduction of an additional amount of Rs.20,000 for investment in long-term infrastructure bonds as notified by the Central Government.  This would be over and above the existing limit of Rs.1 lakh on tax savings.  I am sure that these reliefs will put more money in the hands of individual taxpayers for both consumption as well as saving.",,,,,

Last year, I extended the scope of weighted deduction on expenditure incurred on in-house research and development (R&D) to all manufacturing businesses except for a small negative list.  To further encourage R&D across all sectors of the economy, I now propose to enhance the weighted deduction on expenditure incurred on in-house R&D from 150 per cent to 200 per cent. I also propose to enhance the weighted deduction on payments made to National Laboratories, research associations, colleges, universities and other institutions, for scientific research from 125 per cent to 175 per cent.",,,,,

The income of such approved research associations shall be exempt from tax.",,,,,

2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"135.     To facilitate the business operations of small taxpayers, I had extended the scope of presumptive taxation to all small businesses with a turnover of up to Rs.40 lakh.   To further reduce the compliance burden on small taxpayers, I now propose to enhance this limit to Rs.60 lakh. ",,,,,

2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"137.     Relaxing the current provisions on disallowance of expenditure, I propose to allow deduction of such expenditure, if tax has been deducted at any time during the financial year and paid before the due date of filing the return. This will allow most deductors additional time up to September of the next financial year.  At the same time, I propose to increase the interest charged on tax deducted but not deposited by the specified date, from 12 per cent to 18 per cent per annum. ",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"138.     Last year, I had provided for the taxation of the newly introduced Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) on the same lines as exists for a general partnership firm. To facilitate the conversion of small companies into LLPs, I propose that this will not be subject to capital gains tax.",,,,,

2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,141.     The major objectives that have guided me in the formulation of my proposals on indirect taxes are the need to achieve some degree of fiscal consolidation without impairing the recovery process and moving forward on the road to GST.,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"142.     Unlike the time I presented the last Budget, symptoms of economic recovery are more widespread and clear-cut now. The three fiscal stimulus packages that the Government introduced in quick succession have helped the process of recovery significantly. The improvement in our economic performance encourages a course of fiscal correction even as the global situation warrants caution. Therefore, I propose to partially roll back the rate reduction in Central Excise duties and enhance the standard rate on all non-petroleum products from 8 per cent to 10 per cent ad valorem. The specific rates of duty applicable to portland cement and cement clinker are also being adjusted upwards proportionately. Similarly, the ad valorem component of excise duty on large cars, multi-utility vehicles and sports-utility vehicles which was reduced as part of the first stimulus package, is being increased by 2 percentage points to 22 per cent.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"143.     In the wake of spiralling petroleum prices, Government provided full exemption from basic customs duty to crude petroleum and proportionately reduced the basic duty on refined petroleum products in June, 2008. Compared to the international price of the Indian crude basket of US$ 112 per barrel at that time, the prices are much softer at present. In view of the pressing need to move back to a fiscal consolidation path, I propose to restore the basic duty of 5 per cent on crude petroleum; 7.5 per cent on diesel and petrol and 10 per cent on other refined products. I also propose to enhance the Central Excise duty on petrol and diesel by Re.1 per litre each.",,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"144.     Since I quit smoking many years ago, I would urge others to also follow suit, as smoking is injurious to health. To this end, I am making some structural changes in the excise duty on cigarettes, cigars and cigarillos coupled with some increase in rates. I also propose to enhance excise duty on all non-smoking tobacco such as scented tobacco, snuff, chewing tobacco etc. In addition, I propose to introduce a compounded levy scheme for chewing tobacco and branded unmanufactured tobacco based on the capacity of pouch packing machines.",,,,,

2010-11,Pranab Mukherjee,"164.     Medical equipment, instruments and appliances are subjected to a very complex import duty regime based on several long lists that describe individual items. Multiple rates coupled with descriptions not aligned with tariff lines, result in disputes and at times prevent state-of-art equipment from getting the benefit of exemption. I propose to prescribe a uniform, concessional basic duty of 5 per cent, CVD of 4 per cent with full exemption from special additional duty on all medical equipment. A concessional basic duty of 5 per cent is being prescribed on parts and accessories for the manufacture of such equipment while they would be exempt from CVD and special additional duty. Full exemption currently available to medical equipment and devices such as assistive devices, rehabilitation aids etc. is being retained.

The film industry has been experiencing difficulties in importing digital masters of films for duplication or distribution loaded on electronic medium vis-a-vis  those imported on cinematographic film, owing to a differential customs duty structure. I propose to rationalise this by charging customs duty only on the value of the carrier medium. The same dispensation would apply to music and gaming software imported for duplication.

2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,I rise to present the Union Budget for 2011-12.,,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"We are reaching the end of a remarkable fiscal year. In a globalised world with its share of uncertainties and rapid changes, this year brought us some opportunities and many challenges as we moved ahead with steady steps on the chosen path of fiscal consolidation and high economic growth.",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"Our growth in 2010-11 has been swift and broad-based. The economy is back to its pre-crisis growth trajectory. While agriculture has shown a rebound, industry is regaining its earlier momentum. Services sector continues its near double digit run. Fiscal consolidation has been impressive. This year has also seen significant progress in those critical institutional reforms that would set the pace for double-digit growth in the near future.",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"While we succeeded in making good progress in addressing many areas of our concern, we could have done better in some others. The total food inflation declined from 20.2 per cent in February 2010 to less than half at 9.3 per cent in January 2011, but it still remains a concern. In the medium term perspective, our three priorities of sustaining a high growth trajectory; making development more inclusive; and improving our institutions, public delivery and governance practices, remain relevant. These would continue to engage the Indian policy-planners for some time. However, there are some manifestations of these challenges that need urgent attention in the short term. ",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"Though we have regained the pre-crisis growth momentum, there is a need to effect adjustments in the composition of growth on demand and supply side. We have to ensure that along with private consumption, the revival in private investment is sustained and matches pre-crisis growth rates at the earliest. This requires a stronger fiscal consolidation to enlarge the resource space for private enterprise and addressing some policy constraints.  We also have to improve the supply response of agriculture to the expanding domestic demand. Determined measures on both these issues will help address the structural concerns on inflation management. It will also ensure a more stable macroeconomic environment for continued high growth.",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"The UPA Government has significantly scaled up the flow of resources to rural areas to give a more inclusive thrust to the development process. The impact is visible in the new dynamism of our rural economy. It has helped India navigate itself rapidly out of the quagmire of global economic slowdown. Yet, there is much that still needs to be done, especially in rural India. We have to reconcile legitimate environmental concerns with necessary developmental needs.  Above all, there is the 'challenge of growing aspiration' of a young India. ",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"To address these concerns, I do not foresee resources being a major constraint, at least not in the medium-term. However, the implementation gaps, leakages from public programmes and the quality of our outcomes are a serious challenge. ",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"Certain events in the past few months may have created an impression of drift in governance and a gap in public accountability. Even as the Government is engaged in addressing specific concerns emanating from some of these events in the larger public interest and in upholding the rule of law, such an impression is misplaced. We have to seize in these developments, the opportunity to improve our regulatory standards and administrative practices. Corruption is a problem that we have to fight collectively. ",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"In a complex and rapidly evolving economy, the Government can not profess to be the sole repository of all knowledge. Indeed, in a democratic polity, it stands to benefit from inputs from colleagues on both sides of the House. They must lend their voice and expertise to influence public policy in the wider national interest. In some areas, good results depend on coordinated efforts of the Centre and the State Governments and in some others, on favourable external developments.",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"I see the Budget for 2011-12 as a transition towards a more transparent and result oriented economic management system in India. We are taking major steps in simplifying and placing the administrative procedures concerning taxation, trade and tariffs and social transfers on electronic interface, free of discretion and bureaucratic delays. This will set the tone for a newer, vibrant and more efficient economy. ",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"At times the biggest reforms are not the ones that make headline, but the ones concerned with the details of governance, which affect the everyday life of aam aadmi. In preparing this year's Budget, I have been deeply conscious of this fact. I am grateful for the able guidance of the Hon’ble Prime Minister and the strong support lent by UPA Chairperson Smt. Sonia Gandhi in my endeavour. I would now begin with a brief overview of the economy.",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,I. Overview of the Economy,,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"On last Friday, I laid on the table of the House the Economic Survey 2010-11, which gives a detailed analysis of the economic situation of the country over the past 12 months. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of India is estimated to have grown at 8.6 per cent in 2010-11 in real terms. In 2010-11 agriculture is estimated to have grown at 5.4 per cent, industry at 8.1 per cent and services at 9.6 per cent. All three sectors are contributing to the consolidation of growth. More importantly, the economy has shown remarkable resilience to both external and domestic shocks. ",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"Our principal concern this year has been the continued high food prices. Inflation surfaced in two distinct episodes. At the beginning of the year, food inflation was high for some cereals, sugar and pulses. Towards the second half, while prices of these items moderated and even recorded negative rates of inflation, there was spurt in prices of onion, milk, poultry and some vegetables. Of late prices of onion have crashed in wholesale markets and we have had to remove the ban on their exports. ",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"Despite improvement in the availability of most food items, consumers were denied the benefit of seasonal fall in prices normally seen in winter months. These developments revealed shortcomings in distribution and marketing systems, which are getting accentuated due to growing demand for these food items with rising income levels. The huge differences between wholesale and retail prices and between markets in different parts of the country are just not acceptable. These are at the expense of remunerative prices for farmers and competitive prices for consumers. ",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"Monetary policy stance in 2010-11, while being supportive of fiscal policy, has succeeded in keeping core-inflation in check. As the transmission lag in monetary policy tends to be long, I expect the measures already taken by the RBI to further moderate inflation in coming months.",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"The developments on India's external sector in the current year have been encouraging. Even as the recovery in developed countries is gradually taking root, our trade performance has improved. Exports have grown at 29.4 per cent to reach US Dollar 184.6 billion, while imports at US Dollar 273.6 billion have recorded a growth of 17.6 per cent during April-January 2010-11, over the corresponding period last year. The current account deficit is around the",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,2009-10 level and poses some concerns because of the composition of its financing. ,,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"Policy making in a globalised world has to take into account the likely international developments. To realise the desired outcomes, it is important that there is convergence in expectations of our investors, entrepreneurs and consumers on the macroeconomic prospects of the economy. Against this backdrop, the Indian economy is expected to grow at 9 per cent with an outside band of +/- 0.25 per cent in 2011-12. I expect the average inflation to be lower next year and the current account deficit smaller and better managed with higher domestic savings rate and stable capital flows. While, like last year, I seek the blessings of Lord Indra to bestow on us timely and bountiful monsoons, I would pray to Goddess Lakshmi as well. I think it is a good strategy to diversify one's risks. ",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"In my last Budget, I had started rolling back the fiscal stimulus implemented over 2008-09 and 2009-10 to mitigate the impact of the global financial crisis on economic slowdown in India. In the course of the year, I have moved further on that path. I believe that a part of the current recovery must be stored away to build future resilience. Indeed, a counter cyclical fiscal policy is our best insurance against external shocks and localised domestic factors.",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"The experience with Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003 (FRBM Act) at Centre and the corresponding Acts at State level show that statutory fiscal consolidation targets have a positive effect on macroeconomic management of the economy. In the course of the year the Central Government would introduce an amendment to the FRBM Act, laying down the fiscal road map for the next five years.",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,The Thirteenth Finance Commission has worked out a fiscal consolidation road map for States requiring them to eliminate revenue deficit and achieve a fiscal deficit of 3 per cent of their respective Gross State Domestic Product latest by 2014-15. It has also recommended a combined States’ debt target of 24.3 per cent of GDP to be reached during this period. The States are required to amend or enact their FRBM Acts to conform to these recommendations. ,,,,,

2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"The introduction of the Direct Taxes Code (DTC) and the proposed Goods and Services Tax (GST) will mark a watershed. These reforms will result in moderation of rates, simplification of laws and better compliance. ",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"As Hon'ble Members are aware, the Direct Taxes Code Bill was introduced in Parliament in August, 2010.  After receiving the report of the Standing Committee, we shall be able to finalise the Code for its enactment during",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"2011-12. This has been a pioneering effort in participative legislation.  The Code is proposed to be effective from April 1, 2012 to allow taxpayers, practitioners and administrators to fully understand the legislation and adjust to the revised procedures.",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"Unlike DTC, decisions on the GST have to be taken in concert with the States with whom our dialogue has made considerable progress in the last four years. Areas of divergence have been narrowed. As a step towards the roll-out of GST, I propose to introduce the Constitution Amendment Bill in this session of Parliament. Work is also underway on drafting of the model legislation for the Central and State GST.",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"Among the other steps that are being taken for the introduction of GST is the establishment of a strong IT infrastructure. We have made significant progress on the GST Network (GSTN).  The key business processes of registration, returns and payments are in advanced stages of finalisation. The National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) has been selected as technology partner for incubating the National Information Utility that will establish and operate the IT backbone for GST. By June 2011, NSDL will set up a Pilot portal in collaboration with eleven States prior to its roll out across the country. ",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"The effective management of public expenditure is an integral part of the fiscal consolidation process. Expenditure has to be oriented towards the production of public goods and services. The extant classification of public expenditure between plan, non-plan, revenue and capital spending needs to be revisited. This is necessary as one recognises the importance of service sector and the knowledge economy for our development.  A Committee under Dr. C. Rangarajan has been set up by the Planning Commission to look into these issues. ",,,,,

2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"The Government provides subsidies, notably on fuel and food grains, to enable the common man to have access to these basic necessities at affordable prices. A significant proportion of subsidised fuel does not reach the targeted beneficiaries and there is large scale diversion of subsidised kerosene oil. A recent tragic event has highlighted this practice. We have deliberated for long the modalities of implementing such subsidies. The debate now has to make way for decision. To ensure greater efficiency, cost effectiveness and better delivery for both kerosene and fertilisers, the Government will move towards direct transfer of cash subsidy to people living below poverty line in a phased manner.",,,,,

2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,Agriculture development is central to our growth strategy. Measures taken during the current year have started attracting private investment in agriculture and agro-processing activities. This process has to be deepened further.,,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"In the Budget for 2010-11, I had delineated a four-pronged strategy covering agricultural production, reduction in wastage of produce, credit support to farmers and a thrust to the food processing sector.  These initiatives have started showing results but there are other issues in our food economy that require attention. The recent spurt in food prices was driven by increase in the prices of items like fruits and vegetables, milk, meat, poultry and fish, which account for more than 70 per cent of the WPI basket for primary food items.  Removal of production and distribution bottlenecks for these items will be the focus of my attention this year. I propose to make allocations for these schemes under the ongoing Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) for an early take off. The total allocation of RKVY is being increased from `6,755 crore in 2010-11 to `7,860 crore in 2011-12.",,,,,

2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"The domestic production of edible oil meets only about 50 per cent demand. The gap in supply is met through imports, which are often at high prices due to the quantum of our requirement. Our recent interventions and good rains are expected to result in a higher oilseeds production of 278 lakh tonnes in 2010-11 as against 249 lakh tonnes in 2009-10. To achieve a major breakthrough, we have to pay special attention to oil palm as it is one of the most efficient oil crops. I propose to provide an amount of `300 crore to bring 60,000 hectares under oil palm plantation, by integrating the farmers with the markets. The initiative will yield about 3 lakh metric tonnes of palm oil annually in 5 years. ",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"The growing demand for vegetables has to be met by a robust increase in the productivity and market linkage. An efficient supply chain, to provide quality vegetables at competitive prices will have to be established.

To begin with, this programme will be launched near major urban centres.",,,,,

Bajra, jowar, ragi and other millets are highly nutritious and are known to possess several medicinal properties. The availability and consumption of these Nutri-cereals is, however, low and has been steadily declining over recent years.  A provision of `300 crore is being made to promote higher production of these cereals, upgrade their processing technologies and create awareness regarding their health benefits. This initiative would provide market linked production support to ten lakh millet farmers in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country. The programme would be taken up in 1000 compact blocks covering about 25,000 villages.  This will help improve nutritional security and increase feed and fodder supply for livestock. ",,,,,

2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"While the need to maximize crop yields to meet the growing demand for food grains is critical, we have to sustain agricultural productivity in the long run.

2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"To get the best from their land, farmers need access to affordable credit. Banks have been consistently meeting the targets set for agriculture credit flow in the past few years.  For the year 2011-12, I am raising the target of credit flow to the farmers from `3,75,000 crore this year to `4,75,000 crore in 2011-12.  Banks have been asked to step up direct lending for agriculture and credit to small and marginal farmers. ",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"The existing interest subvention scheme of providing short term crop loans to farmers at 7 per cent interest will be continued during 2011-12.  In the last budget, I had provided an additional 2 per cent interest subvention to those farmers who repay their crop loans on time. The response to this scheme has been good. In order to provide further incentive to these farmers, I propose to enhance the additional subvention to 3 per cent in 2011-12.  Thus, the effective rate of interest for such farmers will be 4 per cent per annum.  ",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"In view of the enhanced target for flow of agriculture credit, I propose to strengthen NABARD's capital base by infusing `3000 crore, in a phased manner, as Government equity.  This would raise its paid-up capital to `5,000 crore. To enable NABARD refinance the short-term crop loans of the cooperative credit institutions and RRBs at concessional rates, I propose a contribution of `10,000 crore to NABARD’s Short-term Rural Credit Fund for 2011-12 from the shortfall in priority sector lending by Scheduled Commercial Banks.",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"Despite growing production of vegetables and fruits, their availability is inadequate due to bottlenecks in retailing capacity. An estimated 40 per cent of the fruit and vegetable production in India goes waste due to lack of storage, cold chain and transport infrastructure. To address these issues, the Eleventh Plan target for number of Mega Food Parks was set at 30. So far, 15 such parks have been sanctioned.

The storage capacity for such large quantities requires augmentation. Process to create new storage capacity of 150 lakh metric tonnes through private entrepreneurs and warehousing corporations has been fast tracked. Decision to create 20 lakh metric tonnes of storage capacity under Public Entrepreneurs Guarantee (PEG) Scheme through modern silos has been taken. While we will be able to add about 2.6 lakh tonnes of capacity by March 2011, based on existing sanctions, the addition will reach 40 lakh tonnes by March 2012.

I also propose to extend the benefit of Government contribution from three to five years for all subscribers of Swavalamban who enroll during 2010-11 and 2011-12.

2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"e-payment of taxes through 32 agency banks, ECS facility for electronic clearing of refunds directly in taxpayers’ bank accounts and electronic filing of TDS returns are now available throughout the country.

Both Boards also invest substantial effort and money in litigation with their employees.

The Plan Expenditure at `4,41,547 crore marks an increase of 18.3 per cent and the Non Plan Expenditure at `8,16,182 crore is an increase of 10.9 per cent over BE 2010-11.  As 2011-12 is the last year of the Eleventh Plan, I am happy to share that Eleventh Plan expenditure in nominal terms is more than 100 per cent of the expenditure envisaged for the Plan period.

2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"The total plan and non-plan transfers of `2,01,733 crore to States and UT Governments in 2011-12 have increased by 23 per cent over the Budget Estimates  2010-11. This includes grants of `13,713 crore in 2011-12 to local bodies as per the recommendation of the Thirteenth Finance Commission.",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"Hon'ble Members are aware that in the course of 2010-11, I had the opportunity to effect a further improvement in the fiscal balance, due to the higher than anticipated non-tax revenues from 3G spectrum auctions. I chose to do that and much more. While I provided additional resources of about `50,000 crore to critical infrastructure and social sectors and also to meet the expenditure on subsidies, I have brought down the fiscal deficit from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent of the GDP for 2010-11. For 2011-12, I have kept it at 4.6 per cent of GDP, which improves upon my own target for 2011-12 indicated in the fiscal road map presented in the last Budget. In the Medium Term Fiscal Policy Statement being presented to the House today, the rolling targets for fiscal deficit are placed at 4.1 per cent for 2012-13, and 3.5 per cent for 2013-14. ",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"There has been some concern expressed regarding the stickiness of Government's revenue deficit in the post-global crisis phase of the economy. For 2010-11 as against a target of 4 per cent, the revenue deficit is estimated at 3.4 per cent of GDP. In the past few years the transfers to States and other developmental expenditure have grown significantly. These are classified as revenue expenditure even though a considerable part of the expenditure from these transfers is in the nature of capital expenditure. In 2010-11, `90,792 crore from such revenue expenditures were in the nature of capital expenditure. Similarly, in 2011-12 grants-in-aid for creation of capital assets, which are now shown separately in the Budget documents, are about `1.47 lakh crore. Taking these budget provisions into account, the “effective revenue deficit” is estimated at 2.3 per cent in the Revised Estimates for 2010-11 and 1.8 per cent for 2011-12.",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"In my last Budget, I had stated that Government would avoid issuing bonds in lieu of subsidies to oil and fertiliser companies. I have adhered to this decision, thereby bringing all subsidy related liabilities into our fiscal accounting. ",,,,,

Taking into account the various other financing items for fiscal deficit, the net market borrowing of the Government in 2011-12 would be `3.43 lakh crore.  In addition, `15,000 crore is proposed to be financed through Treasury Bills. Accordingly, the Central Government debt as a proportion of GDP is estimated at 44.2 per cent for 2011-12 as against 52.5 per cent recommended by the Thirteenth Finance Commission.",,,,,

2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"Last year I provided relief to individual taxpayers by broadening the tax slabs.  To take us closer to DTC rates, I propose to enhance the exemption limit for the general category of individual taxpayers from `1,60,000 to `1,80,000 this year. This measure will provide a uniform tax relief of `2,000 to every taxpayer of this category.",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"Senior citizens deserve our special attention. For them, I propose",,,,,

2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"In the case of corporates, my initiative of phasing out the surcharge continues. I propose to reduce the current surcharge of 7.5 per cent on domestic companies to 5 per cent. Simultaneously, I propose to increase the rate of Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) from the current rate of 18 per cent to 18.5 per cent of book profits to keep the effective rate of the MAT at the same level. As a measure to ensure equal sharing of the corporate tax liability, I propose to levy MAT on developers of Special Economic Zones as well as units operating in SEZs. ",,,,,

2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"It has been represented that the taxation of foreign dividends in the hands of resident taxpayers at full rate is a disincentive for their repatriation to India and they continue to remain invested abroad.

2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,I shall now turn to my indirect tax proposals.,,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"In view of the healthy growth in indirect taxes in 2010-11, I had the option to roll back the Central excise duty to levels prevailing in November 2008. I have chosen not to do so for two reasons. I would like to see improved business margins translated into higher investment rates. I would also like to stay my course towards GST. I have therefore decided to maintain the standard rate of Central excise duty at 10 per cent. ",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"I propose certain changes in the Central Excise rate structure to prepare the ground for the transition to GST, beginning with a reduction in the number of exemptions. At present, there are about 100 items that are exempt from Central Excise as well as State VAT. In addition, there are as many as 370 items that enjoy exemption from Central Excise duty but are chargeable to VAT. I propose to withdraw the exemption on 130 of these items that are mainly in the nature of consumer goods. The remaining 240 items would be brought into the tax net when GST is introduced. ",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"A nominal Central Excise duty of 1 per cent is being imposed on the 130 items that are entering the tax net. No Cenvat credit would be available for the manufacture of these items. Basic food and fuel would continue to be exempt. This levy would also not apply to precious metals and stones. In case of jewellery and articles of gold, silver and precious metals, the levy would apply only to goods sold under a brand name.",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"Most of the States have increased their merit rate of VAT from 4 per cent to 5 per cent. In line with this, I also propose to enhance the lower rate of Central Excise duty from 4 per cent to 5 per cent.",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"Ready-made garments and made-ups of textiles are currently under an optional excise duty regime.  A manufacturer is required to pay duty only if he wishes to avail of Cenvat credit. Our garment and made-ups industry has come of age and has shown handsome growth in recent years.  As part of base expansion, I propose to convert the optional levy into a mandatory levy at a unified rate of 10 per cent. The levy would however, apply only to branded garments or made-ups and not to those tailored or made to order for a retail customer. Credit of tax paid on inputs, capital goods and input services would be available to manufacturers of these products.  Keeping in mind the fragmented nature of this industry, full SSI exemption is also being extended to these products.  Export of these items would continue to be zero-rated.",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"We have a long term commitment to align our customs duty rates to those prevailing in ASEAN countries.  The peak rate of customs duty has been reduced over the years and has settled at 10 per cent.  In view of continued uncertainties in the global economy, I propose to hold the peak rate at its current level.  However, some rationalization is being done to unify three rates namely, 2 per cent, 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent at the middle level of 2.5 per cent. ",,,,,

2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"Iron ore attracts an export duty of 15 per cent in the case of lumps and 5 per cent in the case of fines. This is a natural resource which needs to be conserved.

2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"In the last Budget, Central Excise duty on LED lights was reduced from 8 per cent to 4 per cent to promote their use.

2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,Capital goods imported for the expansion of existing mega or ultra mega power projects enjoy a concessional basic customs duty of 2.5 per cent and full exemption from CVD. This creates a disability for the domestic suppliers who are required to pay Central Excise duty on supplies to such projects. I propose to correct this anomaly by providing a parallel excise duty exemption. ,,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"Bio-based asphalt is an emerging, green technology for the surfacing of roads.

In recent years, many organisations have joined the cause of promoting and popularising both traditional and contemporary art. Some of them have been active in locating heritage works of Indian art and antiquities in foreign countries and bringing them back home. To encourage such initiatives, I propose to expand the scope of this exemption for works of art and antiquities to also apply to imports for exhibition or display, in private art galleries or similar premises that are open to the general public.

2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"I imposed service tax in 2010-11 on health check up or treatment. This levy has resulted in differential treatment between persons who make payments themselves and others where payments are made by an insurance company or a business entity.  Thus, I propose to replace it with a tax on all services provided by hospitals with 25 or more beds that have the facility of central air-conditioning. Though the tax is on high- end treatment, I propose to sweeten the pill by an abatement of 50 per cent so that the actual burden is kept at 5 per cent of the value of service.  I also propose to extend the levy to diagnostic tests of all kinds with the same rate of abatement. However, all Government hospitals shall be outside this levy.  ",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,I propose to raise the service tax on air travel by `50 in the case of domestic air travel and `250 on international journeys by economy class.

2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"The strength of a good value-added-tax lies in the free flow of the credit of the tax paid at the previous stage.  Due to complexities, there have been many legal disputes on the availability of credit on a number of inputs or input services.  These provisions are being rationalized by laying down clear definitions so that the scope of inputs and input services that are eligible and those that are not, is clear.

2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"The number of assessees in service tax has grown manifold.  I find that a large number of them comprise individuals or sole proprietors with small turnovers.

I also intend to give all assessees with turnover upto `60 lakh, the benefit of 3 percentage points in interest on delayed payment.",,,,,
2011-12,Pranab Mukherjee,"In keeping with our thrust to encourage voluntary compliance, the penal provisions for Service Tax are being rationalised. A key component of this strategy would be to treat less harshly those who have maintained truthful records but have fallen short of discharging their tax liability. Simultaneously, deliberate evaders with unrecorded business transactions will be dealt with more severely. Similar changes are being carried out in Central Excise and Customs laws.

2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"Madam Speaker, ",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,I rise to present the Union Budget for 2012-13.,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"For the Indian economy, this was a year of recovery interrupted. When one year ago, I rose to present the Budget, the challenges were many, but there was a sense that the world economy was on the mend. The Budget was presented in the first glimmer of hope. But reality turned out to be different. The sovereign debt crisis in the Euro zone intensified, political turmoil in Middle East injected widespread uncertainty, crude oil prices rose, an earthquake struck Japan and the overall gloom refused to lift.",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"2.While I believe that there should be no room for complacency, nor any excuse for what happens in one’s own country, we will be misled if we ignore the ground realities of the world. The global crisis has affected us. India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is estimated to grow by 6.9 per cent in 2011-12, after having grown at the rate of 8.4 per cent in each of the two preceding years. Though we have been able to limit the adverse impact of this slowdown on our economy, this year’s performance has been disappointing. But it is also a fact that in any cross-country comparison, India still remains among the front runners in economic growth.",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"3.For the better part of the past two years, we had to battle near double-digit headline inflation. Our monetary and fiscal policy response during this period was geared towards taming domestic inflationary pressures. A tight monetary policy impacted investment and consumption growth. The fiscal policy had to absorb expanded outlays on subsidies and duty reductions to limit the pass-through of higher fuel prices to consumers. As a result growth moderated and the fiscal balance deteriorated.",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"4.But there is good news in the detail. With agriculture and services continuing to perform well, India’s slowdown can be attributed almost entirely to weak industrial growth. While we do not have aggregate figures for the last quarter of 2011-12, numerous indicators pertaining to this period suggest that the economy is now turning around. There are signs of recovery in coal, fertilisers, cement and electricity sectors. These are core sectors that have an impact on the entire economy. Indian manufacturing appears to be on the cusp of a revival.",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,5.We are now at a juncture when it is necessary to take hard decisions. We have to improve our macroeconomic environment and strengthen domestic growth drivers to sustain high growth in the medium term. We have to accelerate the pace of reforms and improve supply side management of the economy. ,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"6.We are about to enter the first year of the Twelfth Five Year Plan which aims at “faster, sustainable and more inclusive growth.” The Plan will be launched with the Budget proposals for 2012-13. In keeping with the stated priorities, I have identified five objectives that we must address effectively in the ensuing fiscal year. These are:",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,•Focus on domestic demand driven growth recovery;,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,•Create conditions for rapid revival of high growth in private investment;,,,,,

2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,•Intervene decisively to address the problem of malnutrition especially in the 200 high-burden districts; and,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"•Expedite coordinated implementation of decisions being taken to improve delivery systems, governance, and transparency; and address the problem of black money and corruption in public life.",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"7.Today, India has global responsibilities of a kind that it did not have earlier. Our presence at the high table of global economic policy makers is a matter of some satisfaction. It, however, places new responsibilities on our shoulders. If India can continue to build on its economic strength, it can be a source of stability for the world economy and provide a safe destination for restless global capital. ",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"8.I know that mere words are not enough. What we need is a credible roadmap backed by a set of implementable proposals to meet those objectives. In my attempt to do so, I have benefited from the able guidance of Hon’ble Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, and strong support of the UPA Chairperson Smt. Sonia Gandhi. ",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,I would now begin with a brief overview of the economy.,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,Overview of the Economy,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"9.Yesterday, I laid on the table of the House the Economic Survey",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"2011-12, which gives a detailed analysis of the economy over the past 12 months. India’s GDP is estimated to grow at 6.9 per cent in real terms in 2011-12. The growth is estimated to be 2.5 per cent in agriculture, 3.9 per cent in industry and 9.4 per cent in services.There is a significant slowdown in comparison to the preceding two years, primarily due to deceleration in industrial growth, more specifically in private investment. Rising cost of credit and weak domestic business sentiment, added to this decline.",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"10.The headline inflation remained high for most part of the year. It was only in December 2011 that it moderated to 8.3 per cent followed by 6.6 per cent in January 2012. Monthly food inflation declined from 20.2 per cent in February 2010, to 9.4 per cent in March 2011 and turned negative in January 2012. Though the February 2012 inflation figure has gone up marginally, I expect the headline inflation to moderate further in the next few months and remain stable thereafter. ",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"11.India’s inflation is largely structural, driven predominantly by agricultural supply constraints and global cost push. Evidence suggests that prolonged periods of high food inflation tend to get generalised. Fortunately, steps taken to bridge gaps in distribution, storage and marketing systems to strengthen food supply chains have helped us in a more effective management of inflation and led to a decline in food inflation.",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"12. The developments in India’s external trade in the first half of the current year were encouraging. During April-January 2011-12, exports grew by 23 per cent to reach US Dollar 243 billion, while imports at US Dollar 391 billion recorded a growth of over 29 per cent. What is heartening is that India has successfully achieved diversification of export and import markets. The share of Asia, including ASEAN, in total trade increased from 33.3 per cent in",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,2000-2001 to 57.3 per cent in the first half of 2011-12. This has helped us weather the impact of global crisis emanating from Europe and to a lesser extent from USA.,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"13.The current account deficit as a proportion of GDP for 2011-12 is likely to be around 3.6 per cent. This, along with reduced net capital inflows in the second and third quarters, put pressure on the exchange rate. ",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"14. Taking a bird’s eye view of the entire economy and keeping in mind the difficult global environment, I expect India’s GDP growth in 2012-13 to be 7.6 per cent, +/- 0.25 per cent. ",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"15.I expect average inflation to be lower next year. I also expect the current account deficit to be smaller, aided by improvement in domestic financial savings. ",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,II. Growth ,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,I now turn to growth and fiscal consolidation.,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"16.Our fiscal balance has deteriorated in 2011-12 due to slippage in direct tax revenue and increased subsidies. On both counts our underlying assumptions at the time of Budget presentation last year were belied by subsequent developments. The profit margins came under pressure due to higher interest rates and material costs. This impacted growth in corporate taxes. Further, as against an assumption of US Dollar 90 a barrel, the average price of crude oil in 2011-12 is likely to exceed US Dollar 115. This has necessitated higher outlay on subsidies than projected. The continuing uncertainty in the global environment makes it necessary for us to strike a balance between fiscal consolidation and strengthening macroeconomic fundamentals to create adequate headroom to deal with future shocks.",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,Fiscal Consolidation,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,FRBM Act,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"17.The implementation of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003 (FRBM Act) at Centre and the corresponding Acts at State level was the pivot in the successful consolidation of our fiscal balance prior to the global financial crisis of 2008. The outbreak of the crisis coincided with the year when the mandated targets of 3 per cent fiscal deficit and elimination of revenue deficit were to be achieved. The Government had to deviate from these targets due to injection of fiscal stimulus at that time. Following my announcement in the last Budget Speech, I am now introducing amendments to the FRBM Act as part of Finance Bill, 2012. ",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,Expenditure Reforms,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"18.The fiscal targets for Centre under the amendments to the FRBM Act are indicated in the Budget documents. Meanwhile, I would like to highlight two of its features that are steps in the direction of expenditure reforms. First, the concept of Effective Revenue Deficit, introduced in the last Budget, to address the structural imbalances in the revenue account, is being brought in as a fiscal parameter. Effective Revenue Deficit is the difference between revenue deficit and grants for creation of capital assets. Focusing on this will help in reducing the consumptive component of revenue deficit and create space for increased capital spending. ",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"19.Second, a provision for “Medium-term Expenditure Framework Statement” is being introduced in the Act. This statement shall set forth a three-year rolling target for expenditure indicators. It would help in undertaking a de-novo exercise for allocating resources for prioritised schemes and weeding out others that have outlived their utility. This would provide greater certainty in multi-year budgeting framework. It would also encourage efficiencies in expenditure management. ",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"20.In implementing the Twelfth Plan, the recommendations made by the Expert Committees to streamline and reduce the number of Centrally Sponsored Schemes and to address Plan and non-Plan classification, would be kept in view. The Central Plan Scheme Monitoring System would be expanded to facilitate better tracking and utilisation of funds released by the Central Government. ",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,Subsidies,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"21.Fiscal consolidation calls for efforts both to raise the tax-GDP ratio and to lower the expenditure. In this context, we need to take a close look at the growth of our revenue expenditure, particularly on subsidies. The major subsidies at the Centre are for food, fertilisers and petroleum products. Some subsidies at this juncture in our development are inevitable. But they become undesirable if they compromise the macroeconomic fundamentals of the economy, more so, when they don’t reach the intended beneficiaries. ",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"22.The Government has decided that from 2012-13 subsidies related to food and for administering the Food Security Act will be fully provided for. All other subsidies would be funded to the extent that they can be borne by the economy without any adverse implications. It would be my endeavour to restrict the expenditure on Central subsidies to under 2 per cent of GDP in 2012-13. Over the next three years, it would be further brought down to 1.75 per cent of GDP. Such a step is needed to improve the quality of public spending. Our effort now will be directed towards better targeting and leakage proof delivery of the subsidies. ",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"23. The recommendations of the task force headed by Shri Nandan Nilekani on IT strategy for direct transfer of subsidy have been accepted. Based on these recommendations, a mobile- based Fertiliser Management System (mFMS) has been designed to provide end-to-end information on the movement of fertilisers and subsidies, from the manufacturer to the retail level. This will be rolled out nation-wide during 2012. Direct transfer of subsidy to the retailer, and eventually to the farmer will be implemented in subsequent phases. This step will benefit 12 crore farmer families, while reducing expenditure on subsidies by curtailing misuse of fertilisers.",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,24.All the three public sector Oil Marketing Companies have launched LPG transparency portals to improve customer service and reduce leakage. A pilot project for selling LPG at market price and reimbursement of subsidy directly into the beneficiary’s bank account is being conducted in Mysore. A similar pilot project on direct transfer of subsidy for kerosene into the bank accounts of beneficiaries has been initiated in Alwar district of Rajasthan. The Aadhaar platform has also been successfully used to validate PDS ration cards in Jharkhand. ,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,25.These pilot projects show that substantial economies in subsidy outgo can be achieved by the use of Aadhaar platform. It will be our endeavour to scale up and roll out these Aadhaar enabled payments for various government schemes in at least 50 selected districts within the next six months. ,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,Tax Reforms,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"26.As Hon’ble Members are aware, the Direct Taxes Code (DTC) Bill was introduced in Parliament in August 2010.It was our earnest desire to give effect to DTC from April 1, 2012. However, we received the Report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on March 9, 2012. We will examine the report expeditiously and take steps for the enactment of DTC at the earliest. ",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"27. Similarly, the Constitution Amendment Bill, a preparatory step in the implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) was introduced in Parliament in March 2011 and is before the Parliamentary Standing Committee. As we await recommendations of the Committee, drafting of model legislation for Centre and State GST in concert with States is under progress. ",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"28.The structure of GST Network (GSTN) has been approved by the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers. GSTN will be set up as a National Information Utility and will become operational by August 2012. The GSTN will implement common PAN-based registration, returns filing and payments processing for all States on a shared platform. The use of PAN as a common identifier in both direct and indirect taxes, will enhance transparency and check tax evasion. I solicit the support of all my colleagues cutting across party lines for an early passage of these landmark legislations.",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,Disinvestment Policy,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"29. The Government has further evolved its approach to divestment of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs). The CPSEs are being given a level playing field vis-a-vis the private sector with regard to practices like buy-backs and listing at stock exchange. The treasury management options for CPSEs have also been enhanced. This will help improve the returns on public assets, support transparent environment for the divestment process, besides unlocking the value and resources for all stakeholders. ",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"30.In 2011-12, as against a target of ` 40,000 crore, the Government will raise about ` 14,000 crore from disinvestment. For 2012-13, I propose to raise ",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"` 30,000 crore through disinvestment. Let me reiterate here that while we are committed to enhancing people’s ownership of CPSEs, at least 51 per cent ownership and management control will remain with the Government. ",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,Strengthening Investment Environment,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,31.The domestic investment environment has suffered on multiple counts in the past year. It is time to fast track policy decisions and ensure on-time implementation of major projects. ,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,Foreign Direct Investment,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"32.Organised retail helps in reducing cost of intermediation due to economies of scale, benefiting both consumers and producers. At present, FDI in single brand and in cash and carry wholesale trade is permitted to the extent of 100 per cent. The decision in respect of allowing FDI in multi-brand retail trade up to 51 per cent, subject to compliance with specified conditions, has been held in abeyance. Efforts are on to arrive at a broad based consensus in consultation with the State Governments. ",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,Advance Pricing Agreement,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"33. In a globalised economy with expanding cross-border production chains and growing trade within entities of the same group, Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) can significantly bring down tax litigation and provide tax certainty to foreign investors. Though, the provision for APA has been included in the DTC Bill, 2010, I propose to bring forward its implementation by introducing it in the Finance Bill, 2012.",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,Financial Sector,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,34.Reforms in the financial sector have been pursued with the objective of more efficient market intermediation between savers and investors.,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"35.To encourage flow of savings in financial instruments and improve the depth of domestic capital market, it is proposed to introduce a new scheme called Rajiv Gandhi Equity Savings Scheme. The scheme would allow for income tax deduction of 50 per cent to new retail investors, who invest up to ` 50,000 directly in equities and whose annual income is below ` 10 lakh. The scheme will have a lock-in period of 3 years. The details will be announced in due course.",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,Capital Markets,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"36.During the year 2011-12, we took a series of steps to deepen the capital market and encourage investment in infrastructure sector. These steps included raising of FII investment limit in long-term infrastructure bonds, corporate bonds and government securities. The limit on External Commercial Borrowings (ECB) was also raised and qualified foreign investors were allowed to invest in specified Indian mutual funds and directly in equities.",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,37.I now propose to take the next steps in deepening the reforms in Capital market by:,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,•Allowing Qualified Foreign Investors (QFIs) to access Indian Corporate Bond market;,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"•Simplifying the process of issuing Initial Public Offers (IPOs), lowering their costs and helping companies reach more retail investors in small towns.

2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,VII. Budget Estimates 2012-13,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,I now turn to the Budget Estimates for 2012-13.,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"129.The Gross Tax Receipts are estimated at ` 10,77,612 crore which is an increase of 15.6 per cent over the Budget Estimates and 19.5 per cent over the Revised Estimates for 2011-12. As a percentage of GDP, gross taxes are estimated at 10.6 per cent in BE 2012-13 as against 10.4 per cent in BE 2011-12. After devolution to States, the net tax to Centre in 2012-13 is estimated at ` 7,71,071 crore. The Non Tax Revenue Receipts for 2012-13 are estimated at ` 1,64,614 crore and Non-debt Capital Receipts at ` 41,650 crore. The temporary arrangement to use disinvestment proceeds for capital expenditure in social sector schemes is being extended for one more year to 2012-13. ",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"130.The total expenditure for 2012-13 is budgeted at` 14,90,925 crore. Of this, the Plan Expenditure for 2012-13 is ` 5,21,025 crore, which is 18 per cent higher than the Budget Estimates of 2011-12. This is higher than the 15 per cent increase projected in the Approach to the Twelfth Plan for 2012-13. I am happy to inform the Hon’ble Members that in the Eleventh Plan, we have been able to meet 99 per cent of the total plan outlay. ",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"131.The Non Plan Expenditure for 2012-13 is budgeted at ` 9,69,900 crore which is 8.7 per cent higher than the Revised Estimates for 2011-12 and 18.8 per cent higher than the Budget Estimates for 2011-12. This increase is mainly on account of higher provision for major subsidies. While making adequate provisions for funding the desirable subsidies, as indicated earlier, I am determined to contain the increasing subsidy burden through measures including improved targeting.",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"132.The Plan and Non Plan resources transferred to States and Union Territories including direct transfers to State and district level implementing agencies are ` 3,65,216 crore in BE 2012-13. This includes ` 18,655 crore of grant to local bodies as per the recommendations of Thirteenth Finance Commission.",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"133.The year 2011-12 was one of challenges for fiscal management. Due to the slower economic growth, direct tax collection fell short by ` 32,000 crore of the Budget Estimates. At the same time, the Government absorbed duty reduction in petroleum sector with annual revenue loss of ` 49,000 crore. The Government had to incur higher expenditure on petroleum and fertiliser subsidy to insulate the people from the rising prices. While the outgo on account of subsidies increased, I have ensured that the entire amount is given in cash and not as bonds in lieu of subsidies. This is in line with the approach that I outlined in my Budget Speech for 2010-11.",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"134.The combined effect of lower tax and disinvestment receipts and higher expenditure, mainly on account of subsidies, has pushed the fiscal deficit to 5.9 per cent of GDP in the Revised Estimates for 2011-12. However, I have made a determined attempt to come back to the path of fiscal consolidation in the Budget for 2012-13 by pegging the fiscal deficit at ` 5,13,590 crore which is 5.1 per cent of GDP. After taking into account other items of financing, the net market borrowings through dated securities to finance this deficit is ` 4.79 lakh crore. With this, the total Debt stock at the end of 2012-13 would work out at 45.5 per cent of GDP as compared to the Thirteenth Finance Commission target of 50.5 per cent of GDP. The Effective Revenue Deficit in BE 2012-13 works out to ` 1,85,752 crore which is 1.8 per cent of GDP.",,,,,

2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,I now come to Part B of my proposals.,,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"135.The life of a Finance Minister is not easy. Various players, including policy makers, politicians, agriculturists and business houses, participate in the making of the economy. When everything goes well with the economy, we all share in the joy. However, when things go wrong, it is the Finance Minister who is called upon to administer the medicine. Economic policy, as in medical treatment, often requires us to do something, which, in the short run, may be painful, but is good for us in the long run.

2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"159.Last year, I had initiated a public debate on the desirability of moving towards taxation of services based on a negative list.

2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"173.While the problems faced by exporters of goods with respect to taxes on input services was addressed earlier this year,disbursement of taxes that go into the export of services has been an irritant for long. I now announce a new scheme that will simplify refunds without resorting to voluminous documentation or verification. As an added incentive, such refunds will also be admissible for taxes on taxable services that have been exempted.",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"174.Rules pertaining to the Point of Taxation are also being rationalised, providing greater clarity and removing the irritants. Cenvat credits in a number of areas are being restored. There are a number of other proposals both for the facilitation of business and to check malpractices. I do not wish to take the valuable time of this House for discussing all these proposals.",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"175.You will notice that most of these measures are guided by the need to move towards a system that is simple, equitable and progressive but are unlikely to make the exchequer richer in any significant way. Looking at our vast commitments and to maintain a healthy fiscal situation, I propose to raise the service tax rate from 10 per cent to 12 per cent, with consequential changes in rates for services that have individual tax rates. ",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"176.My proposals from service tax are expected to yield an additional revenue of ` 18,660 crore. Keeping in mind that the share of services in GDP is 59 per cent, you would agree that the proposed increase is not too harsh. ",,,,,

2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"177.In the wake of the global financial crisis in 2008-09, the standard rate of excise duty for non-petroleum goods was reduced from 14 per cent to 8 per cent in a phased manner. This rate was raised from 8 per cent to 10 per cent in Budget 2010-11. Given the imperative for fiscal correction, I propose to now raise the standard rate from 10 per cent to 12 per cent, the merit rate from 5 per cent to 6 per cent, andthe lower merit rate from 1 per cent to 2 per cent. However, the lower merit rate for coal, fertilisers, mobile phones and precious metal jewellery is being retained at 1 per cent.",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"178.Large cars currently attract excise duty depending on their engine capacity and length. In keeping with the increase proposed in the standard rate, I propose to enhance the duty from 22 per cent to 24 per cent. In the case of cars that attract a mixed rate of duty of 22 per cent + `15000 per vehicle, I propose to increase the duty and switch over to an ad valorem rate of 27 per cent. ",,,,,
2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"179.No change is proposed in the peak rate of customs duty of 10 per cent on non-agricultural goods. Barring a few individual items, the rates below the peak are also being retained. ",,,,,

2012-13,Pranab Mukherjee,"220.For the Indian economy, this was a challenging year. A number of global and domestic factors militated against the growth that had revived in the last two years. But India has thrived under challenges and India will do so now. In the middle of every crisis, there is also an opportunity. It is an opportunity to re-think, re-assess and make way for new ideas and policies. It is in this spirit that I approached the Budget of this year. The aim is to create an enabling atmosphere for corporates, farmers, entrepreneurs and workers to take initiatives for robust growth. The aim is also to ensure that the benefits of growth reach all sections of population. India stands on the brink of a major resurgence. Whether or not today’s announcements make tomorrow morning’s headlines matters little, as long as they help in shaping the headlines that describe India a decade from now.",,,,,

2013-14,P. Chidambaram,"Madam Speaker, ",,,,,
2013-14,P. Chidambaram,I rise to present the Budget for the year 2013-14.,,,,,
2013-14,P. Chidambaram,"2.I recall my last tenure as Finance Minister and acknowledge with gratitude the splendid support that I received from all sections of the House as well as the people of India.Today, more than ever, I seek the same support as we navigate the Indian economy through a crisis that has enveloped the whole world and spared none.",,,,,
2013-14,P. Chidambaram,"3.I intend to keep my speech simple, straight forward and reasonably short.",,,,,
2013-14,P. Chidambaram,I.THE ECONOMY AND THE CHALLENGES,,,,,
2013-14,P. Chidambaram,"4.I shall begin by setting the context.Global economic growth slowed from 3.9 percent in 2011 to 3.2 percent in 2012.India is part of the global economy: our exports and imports amount to 43 percent of GDP and two-way external sector transactions have risen to 108 percent of GDP.We are not unaffected by what happens in the rest of the world and our economy too has slowed after 2010-11.In the current year, the CSO has estimated growth at 5 percent while the RBI has estimated growth at 5.5 percent.Whatever may be the final estimate, it will be below India’s potential growth rate of 8 percent.Getting back to that growth rate is the challenge that faces the country.",,,,,
2013-14,P. Chidambaram,"5.Let me say, however, there is no reason for gloom or pessimism.Even now, of the large countries of the world, only China and Indonesia are growing faster than India in 2012-13.And in 2013-14, if we grow at the rate projected by many forecasters, only China will grow faster than India.Between 2004 and 2008, and again in 2009-10 and 2010-11, the growth rate was over 8 percent and, in fact, crossed 9 percent in four of those six years.The average for the 11th Plan period, entirely under the UPA Government, was 8 percent, the highest ever in any Plan period.Achieving high growth, therefore, is not a novelty or beyond our capacity.We have done it before and we can do it again.",,,,,
2013-14,P. Chidambaram,"6.I acknowledge that the Indian economy is challenged, but I am absolutely confident that, with your cooperation, we will get out of the trough and get on to the high growth path.I shall now outline our plans and priorities.",,,,,
2013-14,P. Chidambaram,7.Our goal is ‘higher growth leading to inclusive and sustainable development’.That is the mool mantra.,,,,,
2013-14,P. Chidambaram,"8.Growth is a necessary condition and we must unhesitatingly embrace growth as the highest goal.It is growth that will lead to inclusive development, without growth there will be neither development nor inclusiveness.However, I may sound a note of caution.Owing to the plurality and diversity of India, and centuries of neglect, discrimination and deprivation, many sections of the people will be left behind if we do not pay special attention to them.As Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel prize-winning economist, said, “There is a compelling moral case for equity; but it is also necessary if there is to be sustained growth.A country’s most important resource is its people.”We have examples of States growing at a fast rate, but leaving behind women, the scheduled castes, the scheduled tribes, the minorities, and some backward classes.The UPA does not accept that model.The UPA Government believes in inclusive development, with emphasis on improving human development indicators.I hope this Budget will be yet another testimony to that commitment.",,,,,
2013-14,P. Chidambaram,"Fiscal Deficit, Current Account Deficit and Inflation",,,,,
2013-14,P. Chidambaram,"9.The purpose of a Budget – and the job of a Finance Minister – is to create the economic space and find the resources to achieve the socio economic objectives.At present, the economic space is constrained because of a high fiscal deficit; reliance on foreign inflows to finance the current account deficit; lower savings and lower investment; a tight monetary policy to contain inflation; and strong external headwinds.During the course of my speech, I shall spell out measures that will address each of these issues.",,,,,
2013-14,P. Chidambaram,"10.In September, 2012, Government accepted the main recommendations of the Dr. Vijay Kelkar Committee.A new fiscal consolidation path was announced.Red lines were drawn for the fiscal deficit at 5.3 percent of GDP this year and 4.8 percent of GDP in 2013-14.I know there is a lot of scepticism.In a little while, I shall tell you how we have fared.",,,,,
2013-14,P. Chidambaram,"11.My greater worry is the current account deficit (CAD).The CAD continues to be high mainly because of our excessive dependence on oil imports, the high volume of coal imports, our passion for gold, and the slow down in exports.This year, and perhaps next year too, we have to find over USD 75 billion to finance the CAD.There are only three ways before us:FDI, FII or External Commercial Borrowing (ECB).That is why I have been at pains to state over and over again that India, at the present juncture, does not have the choice between welcoming and spurning foreign investment.If I may be frank, foreign investment is an imperative.What we can do is to encourage foreign investment that is consistent with our economic objectives.",,,,,
2013-14,P. Chidambaram,"12.Finally, the development must be sustainable – economically and ecologically.The development model must have democratic legitimacy and approval.",,,,,
2013-14,P. Chidambaram,"13.Looming large over our efforts to stimulate growth is inflation.Some inflation is imported.Supply demand mismatch, for example in oilseeds and pulses, also pushes up inflation.Aggregate demand is another cause of inflation.The battle against inflation must be fought on all fronts.Our efforts in the past few months have brought down headline WPI inflation to about 7.0 percent and core inflation to about 4.2 percent.It is food inflation that is worrying, and we shall take all possible steps to augment the supply side to meet the growing demand for food items.",,,,,
2013-14,P. Chidambaram,"14.Government expenditure boosts aggregate demand and it has both good and bad consequences.Wisdom lies in finding the correct level of government expenditure.In the budget for 2012-13, the estimate of Plan Expenditure was too ambitious and the estimate of non-Plan Expenditure was too conservative. Faced with a huge fiscal deficit, I had no choice but to rationalise expenditure.We took a dose of bitter medicine.It seems to be working.We also took some policy decisions that had been deferred for too long, corrected some prices, and undertook a review of certain tax policies.We have retrieved some economic space.As I outline our plans and priorities, Hon’ble Members will find that I have used that economic space to advantage – and to advance the UPA Government’s socio-economic objectives.",,,,,
2013-14,P. Chidambaram,II.THE PLAN AND BUDGETARY ALLOCATIONS,,,,,
2013-14,P. Chidambaram,"15.The 12th Five Year Plan began in 2012-13.Anticipating a global and domestic recovery, total expenditure had been fixed at `14,90,925 crore.Due to the slowdown and the austerity measures, the revised estimate is `14,30,825 crore or 96 percent of the budget estimate. The economic space that we have gained has given me the confidence to be more ambitious in 2013-14. I have been able to set the BE of total expenditure at `16,65,297 crore and of plan expenditure at `5,55,322 crore.Hon’ble Members will be happy to know that plan expenditure in 2013-14 will be 29.4 percent more than the revised estimate of the current year.All flagship programmes have been fully and adequately funded. I dare say I have provided sufficient funds to each Ministry or Department consistent with their capacity to spend the funds.Now, it is over to the Ministries and Departments to deliver the outcomes through good governance, prudent cash management, close monitoring and timely implementation.",,,,,
2013-14,P. Chidambaram,"16.Madam Speaker, on the one side is economic policy.On the other side is economic welfare.We are a developing country.The link between policy and welfare can be expressed in a few words: opportunities, education, skills, jobs and incomes.Every mother understands this.Every young man and woman understands this.My budget for 2013-14 has before it one overarching goal: to create opportunities for our youth to acquire education and skills that will get them decent jobs or self-employment that will bring them adequate incomes that will enable them to live with their families in a safe and secure environment.",,,,,
2013-14,P. Chidambaram,"SC, ST, Women and Children",,,,,

BRGF will include a State component for Bihar, the Bundelkand region, West Bengal, the KBK districts of Odisha and the 82 districts under the Integrated Action Plan.The present criteria for determining backwardness are based on terrain, density of population and length of international borders.It may be more relevant to use a measure like the distance of the State from the national average under criteria such as per capita income, literacy and other human development indicators.I propose to evolve new criteria and reflect them in future planning and devolution of funds.",,,,,

2013-14,P. Chidambaram,"112.To the women of India:We have a collective responsibility to ensure the dignity and safety of women.Recent incidents have cast a long, dark shadow on our liberal and progressive credentials.As more women enter public spaces – for education or work or access to services or leisure – there are more reports of violence against them.We stand in solidarity with our girl children and women. And we pledge to do everything possible to empower them and to keep them safe and secure.A number of initiatives are under way and many more will be taken by Government as well as non-government organisations.These deserve our support.As an earnest of our commitment to these objectives, I propose to set up a fund – let us call it the Nirbhaya Fund – and Government will contribute `1,000 crore.Ministry of Women and Child Development and other ministries concerned will be requested to work out the details of the structure, scope and application of the fund.",,,,,
2013-14,P. Chidambaram,"113.To the youth of India: A large number of youth must be motivated to voluntarily join skill development programmes.I propose to ask the National Skill Development Corporation to set the curriculum and standards for training in different skills.Any institution or body may offer training courses.At the end of the training, the candidate will be required to take a test conducted by authorised certification bodies.Upon passing the test, the candidate will be given a certificate as well as a monetary reward of an average of `10,000 per candidate.Skill-trained youth will give an enormous boost to employability and productivity.On the assumption that 10,00,000 youth can be motivated, I propose to set apart `1,000 crore for this ambitious scheme.I hope that this will be the trigger to extend skill development to all the youth of the country.",,,,,
2013-14,P. Chidambaram,"114.To the poor of India:The Direct Benefit Transfer scheme has captured the imagination of the people, especially the poor.The Government is the government of the people.The money is the money belonging to the people.When we say “Aapka paisa aapke haath”, why should anyone oppose it?We have made a modest and cautious beginning on the 1st of January, 2013.Nearly 11 lakh beneficiaries have received the benefit directly into their bank accounts.All around us, we see the smiles on the faces of the dalit girls and the tribal boys who have received their scholarships.We see the happiness on the faces of the pregnant women who are assured that the Government cares for the mother and the child before and after child birth.We are redoubling our efforts to ensure that the digitized beneficiary lists are available; that a bank account is opened for each beneficiary; and that the bank account is seeded with Aadhaar in due course.I assure the House and the people of India that the DBT scheme will be rolled out throughout the country during the term of the UPA Government.

2013-14,P. Chidambaram,"120.When I took over in August, 2012, I made a statement that “clarity in tax laws, a stable tax regime, a non-adversarial tax administration, a fair mechanism for dispute resolution, and an independent judiciary will provide great assurance”.That statement is the underlying theme of my tax proposals, both on the direct taxes side and on the indirect taxes side.",,,,,
2013-14,P. Chidambaram,121.An emerging economy must have a tax system that reflects best global practices.I propose to set up a Tax Administration Reform Commission to review the application of tax policies and tax laws and submit periodic reports that can be implemented to strengthen the capacity of our tax system.,,,,,
2013-14,P. Chidambaram,"122.In 2011-12, the tax GDP ratio was 5.5 percent for direct taxes and 4.4 percent for indirect taxes.These ratios are one of the lowest for any large developing country and will not garner adequate resources for inclusive and sustainable development.I may recall that in 2007-08, the tax GDP ratio touched a peak of 11.9 percent.In the short term, we must reclaim that peak.",,,,,

2013-14,P. Chidambaram,"125.The rates of personal income tax have survived four Finance Ministers and four Governments.The current slabs were introduced only last year.Hence, I am afraid, there is no case to revise either the slabs or the rates.Besides, even a moderate increase in the level of threshold exemption will mean that hundreds of thousands of tax payers will go out of the tax net and the tax base will be severely eroded.Nevertheless, I am inclined to give some relief to the tax payers in the first bracket of `2 lakh to `5 lakh.Assuming an inflation rate of 10 percent and a notional rise in the threshold exemption from `2,00,000 to `2,20,000, I propose to provide a tax credit of `2,000 to every person who has a total income upto `5 lakh. 1.8 crore tax payers are expected to benefit to the value of `3,600 crore.

I propose to take the first decisive step by setting apart, in the Budget, a sum of `9,000 crore towards the first instalment of the balance of CST compensation.I appeal to the State Finance Ministers to realise the serious intent of the Government to introduce GST and come forward to work with the Government and bring about a transformational change in the tax structure of the country.",,,,,

2014-15,Arun Jaitley,STATE OF THE ECONOMY,,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"2.The people of India have decisively voted for a change. The verdict represents the exasperation of the people with the status-quo. India unhesitatingly desires to grow. Those living below the poverty line are anxious to free themselves from the curse of poverty. Those who have got an opportunity to emerge from the difficult challenges have become aspirational. They now want to be a part of the neo middle class. Their next generation has the hunger to use the opportunity that society provides for them. Slow decision making has resulted in a loss of opportunity. Two years of sub five per cent growth in the Indian economy has resulted in a challenging situation. We look forward to lower levels of inflation as compared to the days of double digit rates of food inflation in the last two years. The country is in no mood to suffer unemployment, inadequate basic amenities, lack of infrastructure and apathetic governance.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"3.The slowdown in India broadly reflects the trend in many economies. In contrast to the aftermath of the crisis of 2008-09 when restoration of growth in advanced economies was the primary concern, the continuing slowdown being presently witnessed in many emerging economies has posed a threat to a sustained global recovery. Fortunately, there are green shoots of recovery being seen in the global economy. As per IMF, the world economy is projected to grow at 3.6 per cent in 2014 vis-à-vis 3.0 per cent in 2013, with the Euro area expected to register a positive growth after the contraction witnessed in 2012 and 2013. However, the performance of the US economy with attendant implication for the unconventional monetary policy stance and global financial conditions is pivotal to the fate of global recovery in the coming years. These are the head winds against which the Indian economy would have to maneuver its way to attain high growth trajectory. ",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"4.As Finance Minister I am duty bound to usher in a policy regime that will result in the desired macro-economic outcome of higher growth, lower inflation, sustained level of external sector balance and a prudent policy stance. The Budget is the most comprehensive action plan in this regard. In the first Budget of this NDA government that I am presenting before the august House, my aim is to lay down a broad policy indicator of the direction in which we wish to take this country. The steps that I will announce in this Budget are only the beginning of a journey towards a sustained growth of 7-8 per cent or above within the next 3-4 years along with macro-economic stabilization that includes lower levels of inflation, lesser fiscal deficit and a manageable current account deficit. Therefore, it would not be wise to expect everything that can be done or must be done to be in the first Budget presented within forty five days of the formation of this Government.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"5.While higher growth is a sine qua non, we cannot be oblivious of the fact that there is a large population of this country which is below the poverty line. It is the poor who suffer the most. We have to ensure that our anti-poverty programs are well targeted.  The growing aspirations of the people will be reflected in the development strategy followed by the Government led by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and its mandate of “Sab ka Saath Sab ka Vikas”. Allow me to assure this House that we have taken up the challenge in the right earnest. We shall leave no stone unturned in creating a vibrant and strong India. ",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"6.The prevailing economic situation presents a great challenge.  It calls for a conscious choice to be made by all of us. Should we allow this drift to carry on and watch helplessly? Should we allow our future to suffer because of our indecisiveness? Should we be victims of mere populism or wasteful expenditure? To me, the response and the remedy are both clear. The task before me today is very challenging because we need to revive growth, particularly in manufacturing and infrastructure to raise adequate resources for our developmental needs. On the other hand, the task is simple if we accept the principle that we cannot spend beyond our means. We need to introduce fiscal prudence that will lead to fiscal consolidation and discipline. Fiscal prudence to me is of paramount importance because of considerations of inter-generational equity. We cannot leave behind a legacy of debt for our future generations. We cannot go on spending today which would be financed by taxation at a future date. There is an urgent need to generate more resources to fuel the economy. For this, the tax to GDP ratio must be improved and non-tax revenues increased. We must remember that the decline in fiscal deficit from 5.7 per cent of GDP in 2011-12 to 4.8 per cent in 2012-13 and 4.5 per cent in 2013-14 was mainly achieved by reduction in expenditure rather than by way of realization of higher revenue. Although, the external sector witnessed a turn-around with the year ending with a Current Account Deficit of 1.7 per cent of the GDP against 4.7 per cent in 2012-13, this was mainly achieved through restriction on non-essential imports and slowdown in overall aggregate demand. Going forward, we must continue to be watchful of the CAD.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"7.My predecessor has set up a very difficult task of reducing fiscal deficit to 4.1 per cent of the GDP in the current year. Considering that we had two years of low GDP growth, an almost static industrial growth, a moderate increase in indirect taxes, a large subsidy burden and not so encouraging tax buoyancy, the target of 4.1 per cent fiscal deficit is indeed daunting. Difficult, as it may appear, I have decided to accept this target as a challenge. One fails only when one stops trying. My Road map for fiscal consolidation is a fiscal deficit of 3.6 per cent for 2015-16 and 3 per cent for 2016-17. I am conscious of the fact that Iraq crisis is leaving an impact on oil prices and the situation in the middle-east continues to be volatile. Monsoon this year appears more unpredictable. While inflation has remained at elevated levels relative to what is perceived as acceptable, there has been a gradual moderation in WPI recently, from a high of 7.35% in 2012-13 and 5.98% in 2013-14. But we are still not out of the woods. We also must address fully the problem of black money which is curse of our economy. Faced with these adversities we have no option but to undertake some bold steps in order to enhance economic activity and spur growth in the economy. These steps are only the beginning of our effort to revive the growth spirit of the Indian Economy. They are directional.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,Expenditure Management Commission,,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"8.My Government is committed to the principle of “Minimum Government Maximum Governance”. To achieve this goal, time has come to review the allocative and operational efficiencies of Government expenditure to achieve maximum output. The Government will constitute an Expenditure Management Commission, which will look into various aspects of expenditure reforms to be undertaken by the Government. The Commission will give its interim report within this financial year. I also propose to overhaul the subsidy regime, including food and petroleum subsidies, and make it more targeted while providing full protection to the marginalized, poor and SC/STs. A new urea policy would also be formulated.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,GST,,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"9.The debate whether to introduce a Goods and Services Tax (GST) must now come to an end. We have discussed the issue for the past many years. Some States have been apprehensive about surrendering their taxation jurisdiction; others want to be adequately compensated. I have discussed the matter with the States both individually and collectively. I do hope we are able to find a solution in the course of this year and approve the legislative scheme which enables the introduction of GST. This will streamline the tax administration, avoid harassment of the business and result in higher revenue collection both for the Centre and the States. I assure all States that government will be more than fair in dealing with them.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,Tax Administration,,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"10.The sovereign right of the Government to undertake retrospective legislation is unquestionable. However, this power has to be exercised with extreme caution and judiciousness keeping in mind the impact of each such measure on the economy and the overall investment climate. This Government will not ordinarily bring about any change retrospectively which creates a fresh liability. Hon’ble Members are aware that consequent upon certain retrospective amendments to the Income Tax Act 1961 undertaken through the Finance Act 2012, a few cases have come up in various courts and other legal fora. These cases are at different stages of pendency and will naturally reach their logical conclusion. At this juncture I would like to convey to this August House and also the investors community at large that we are committed to provide a stable and predictable taxation regime that would be investor friendly and spur growth. Keeping this in mind, we have decided that henceforth, all fresh cases arising out of the retrospective amendments of 2012 in respect of indirect transfers and coming to the notice of the Assessing Officers will be scrutinized by a High Level Committee to be constituted by the CBDT before any action is initiated in such cases. I hope the investor community both within India and abroad would repose confidence on our stated position and participate in the Indian growth story with renewed vigour.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,Advance Ruling and Other Tax Related Measures,,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"11.Tax demand of more than ` 4 lakh crore is under dispute and litigation before various Courts and Appellate authorities. This is one of the serious concerns of all taxpayers in this country. In order to reduce litigation in direct taxes, I propose to make certain legislative and administrative changes.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"12.Currently, an advance ruling can be obtained about the tax liability of a non-resident from the Authority for Advance Rulings. This facility is not available to resident taxpayers except Public Sector Undertakings. I propose to enable resident taxpayers to obtain an advance ruling in respect of their income tax liability above a defined threshold. I also propose to strengthen the Authority for Advance Rulings by constituting additional benches. I further propose to enlarge the scope of the Income-tax Settlement Commission so that taxpayers may approach the Commission for settlement of disputes. This would continue to be once in a lifetime opportunity for any taxpayer.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"13.As an administrative measure, I propose to set up a High Level Committee to interact with trade and industry on a regular basis and ascertain areas where clarity in tax laws is required. Based on the recommendations of the Committee, the Central Board of Direct Taxes and the Central Board of Excise and Customs shall issue appropriate clarifications, wherever considered necessary, on the tax issues within a period of two months.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"14.Transfer Pricing is a major area of litigation for both resident and non-resident taxpayers. I have proposed certain changes in the Transfer Pricing regulations, which I would spell out in Part-B of my speech.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,15.I hope these measures would go a long way in improving the confidence of taxpayers in the tax system and would provide certainty and clarity in tax laws. ,,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,FDI,,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,16.The policy of the NDA Government is to promote Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) selectively in sectors where it helps the larger interest of the Indian Economy. FDI in several sectors is an additionality of resource which helps in promoting domestic manufacture and job creation. India today needs a boost for job creation. Our manufacturing sector in particular needs a push for job creation. ,,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,17. India today is the largest buyer of Defence equipment in the world. Our domestic manufacturing capacities are still at a nascent stage. We are buying substantial part of our Defence requirements directly from foreign players. Companies controlled by foreign governments and foreign private sector are supplying our Defence requirements to us at a considerable outflow of foreign exchange. Currently we permit 26 per cent FDI in Defence manufacturing. The composite cap of foreign exchange is being raised to 49 per cent with full Indian management and control through the FIPB route.,,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"18.The Insurance sector is investment starved. Several segments of the Insurance sector need an expansion. The composite cap in the Insurance sector is proposed to be increased up to 49 per cent from the current level of 26 per cent, with full Indian management and control, through the FIPB route.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"19.To encourage development of Smart Cities, which will also provide habitation for the neo-middle class, requirement of the built up area and capital conditions for FDI is being reduced from 50,000 square metres to 20,000 square metres and from USD 10 million to USD 5 million respectively with a three year post completion lock in.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"20.To further encourage this, projects which commit at least 30 per cent of the total project cost for low cost affordable housing will be exempted from minimum built up area and capitalisation requirements, with the condition of three year lock-in.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,21.FDI in the manufacturing sector is today on the automatic route. The manufacturing units will be allowed to sell its products through retail including E-commerce platforms without any additional approval.,,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,Bank Capitalization,,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"22.Financial stability is the foundation of a rapid recovery. Our banking system needs to be further strengthened. To be in line with Basel-III norms there is a requirement to infuse ` 2,40,000 crore as equity by 2018 in our banks. To meet this huge capital requirement we need to raise additional resources to fulfill this obligation. While preserving the public ownership, the capital of these banks will be raised by increasing the shareholding of the people in a phased manner through the sale of shares largely through retail to common citizens of this country. Thus, while the government will continue to have majority shareholding, the citizens of India will also get direct shareholding in these banks, which currently they hold indirectly. We will also examine the proposal to give greater autonomy to the banks while making them accountable.",,,,,

2014-15,Arun Jaitley,BUDGET ESTIMATES,,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"181.I now turn to the Budget estimates for Main Budget 2014-15. We have inherited a legacy, wherein, continuance of fiscal consolidation cannot be compromised while providing for the essential items. However, we have mandate to fulfill for the people. Keeping this in mind we have prepared the estimates of expenditure and receipts for Financial Year 2014-15.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"182.Non-Plan expenditure estimates for the Financial Year are ` 12,19,892 crore. While preparing Non-Plan estimates due care has been taken to fully provide for all the essential activities. Additional amounts have been provided for fertilizer subsidy and capital expenditure of Armed Forces.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"183.While preparing estimates of plan expenditure, attention was paid to the absorptive capacity of the Department and on achieving greater outcome with the same financial outlay. In 2013-14, plan funds to the tune of ` 4,53,085 crore could be utilised. Plan allocation of `5,75,000 crore in the Main Budget 2014-15 mark an increase of 26.9% over actuals for 2013-14 and have been targeted towards Agriculture, capacity creation in Health and Education, Rural Roads and National Highways Infrastructure, Railways network expansion, clean energy initiatives, development of water resources and river conservation plans.

2014-15,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,TAX PROPOSALS,,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"188.Madam Speaker, I shall now present my tax proposals.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"189.Taxes are important for every economy to fund Government expenditure on security and welfare of its people.  In the interim Budget 2014-15, my predecessor had set revenue collection targets for direct taxes as well as indirect taxes, which appear to be ambitious. I propose to retain these targets and it shall be my endeavour to achieve the same.  The impact of the tax changes now proposed have of course been factored into the Budget Estimates, 2014-15.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"190.While preparing the tax proposals, I had to encounter the challenge of an extremely limited fiscal space.  Nonetheless, I propose to introduce measures to revive the economy, promote investment in manufacturing sector and rationalize tax provisions so as to reduce litigation as well as to address the problem of inverted duty structure in certain areas.  I also propose to give relief to individual taxpayers and to certain sectors of the economy.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,Direct Taxes ,,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,191.Let me begin with direct taxes.,,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"192.Madam Speaker, I do not propose to make any change in the tax rate.  However, with a view to provide relief to small and marginal taxpayers and senior citizens, I propose to increase personal income tax exemption limit by `50,000 that is, from ` 2 lakh to ` 2.5 lakh in the case of  individual taxpayers who are below the age of 60 years.  Similarly, I also propose to raise the exemption limit from ` 2.5 lakh to ` 3 lakh in the case of senior citizens.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"193.I do not propose to make any change in the rate of surcharge either for the corporates or the individuals, HUFs, firms etc. ",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,194.The education cess for all taxpayers shall continue at 3 percent.,,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"195.In the year 2012-13 the gross domestic savings were 30.1% of the GDP as compared to 33.7% in the year 2009-10.  Increase in savings and their productive use leads to higher economic growth.  The households are the main contributors to savings.  Therefore, to encourage domestic investment in long term savings, I propose to increase the investment limit under section 80C of the Income-tax Act from ` 1 lakh to ` 1.5 lakh.  ",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"196.Housing continues to be an area of concern for middle and lower middle class due to high cost of financing.  Therefore, to reduce this burden, I propose to increase the deduction limit on account of interest on loan in respect of self occupied house property from ` 1.5 lakh to ` 2 lakh.  ",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"197.Infrastructure and construction sectors have a significant role in the economy.  Growth in these sectors is necessary to revive the economy and generate jobs for millions of our young boys and girls. As stated earlier and with a view to attract large scale investment in these sectors, I have provided a conducive tax regime for Infrastructure Investment Trusts and Real Estate Investment Trusts to be set up in accordance with regulations of the Securities and Exchange Board of India.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"198.The manufacturing sector is of paramount importance for the growth of our economy.  This sector has multiplier effect on creation of jobs. Last year, an incentive in the form of investment allowance to a manufacturing company that invests more than ` 100 crore in plant and machinery during the period from 01.04.2013 to 31.03.2015 was announced.  Considering the need to incentivize smaller entrepreneurs, I propose to provide investment allowance at the rate of 15 percent to a manufacturing company that invests more than ` 25 crore in any year in new plant and machinery. This benefit will be available for three years i.e. for investments upto 31.03.2017.  The Scheme announced last year will continue to operate in parallel  till 31.03.2015.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"199.I also propose to extend the investment linked deduction to two new sectors, namely, slurry pipelines for the transportation of iron ore, and semi-conductor wafer fabrication manufacturing units.  This will boost investment in these two critical sectors.  ",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"200.Supply of power continues to be a major area of concern for the country. Therefore, instead of annual extensions, I propose to extend the 10 year tax holiday to the undertakings which begin generation, distribution and transmission of power by 31.03.2017. This stability in our policy will help the investors to plan their investments better.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"201.Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have invested more than ` 8 lakh crore (about 130 billion US $) in India.  One of their concerns is uncertainty in taxation on account of characterization of their income.  Moreover, the fund managers of these foreign investors remain outside India under the apprehension that their presence in India may have adverse tax consequences.  With a view to put an end to this uncertainty and to encourage these fund managers to shift to India, I propose to provide that income arising to foreign portfolio investors from transaction in securities will be treated as capital gains.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,202.The concessional rate of tax at 15 percent on dividends received by Indian companies from their foreign subsidiaries has resulted in enhanced repatriation of funds from abroad. I propose to continue with this concessional rate of 15 percent on foreign dividends without any sunset date.  This will ensure stability of taxation policy.,,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"203.In order to augment low cost long term foreign borrowings for Indian companies, I propose to extend the eligible date of borrowing in foreign currency from 30.06.2016 to 30.06.2017 for a concessional tax rate of 5 percent on interest payments.  I also propose to extend this tax incentive to all types of bonds instead of only infrastructure bonds.  I hope this measure will enable the companies to step up their investments in India.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"204.In order to reduce litigation on transfer pricing issues, I propose to make certain changes in Transfer Pricing regulations.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"(1)An Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) scheme was introduced in the year 2012. It has received good response. I propose to strengthen the administrative set up of APA to expedite disposal of applications. Further, I propose to introduce a “Roll Back” provision in the APA scheme so that an APA entered into for future transactions may also be applied to international transactions undertaken in previous four years in specified circumstances.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"(2)In order to align Transfer Pricing regulations in India with the best available practices, I propose to introduce range concept for determination of arm’s length price. However, the arithmetic mean concept will continue to apply where number of comparable is inadequate. The relevant data is under analysis and appropriate rules will be prescribed.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"(3)As per existing provisions of Transfer Pricing Regulations, only one year data is allowed to be used for comparable analysis with some exception. I propose to amend the regulations to allow use of multiple year data.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,Necessary legislative amendments to give effect to the above proposals including those relating to the Authority for Advance Rulings and Income-tax Settlement Commission will be moved in the current session of the Parliament.,,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"205.In the case of Mutual Funds, other than equity oriented funds, the capital gains arising on transfer of units held for more than a year is taxed at a concessional rate of 10% whereas direct investments in banks and other debt instruments attract a higher rate of tax.  This allows tax arbitrage opportunity.  This arbitrage has hardly benefitted retail investors as their percentage is very small among such Mutual Fund investors.  With a view to remove this tax arbitrage, I propose to increase the rate of tax on long term capital gains from 10 percent to 20 percent on transfer of units of such funds.  I also propose to increase the period of holding in respect of such units from 12 months to 36 months for this purpose.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"206.In the year 2003, the tax liability on income by way of dividends was shifted from the shareholder to the company. The shareholder was required to pay tax on the gross dividends, but now the company pays tax on the dividend amount net of taxes.  Similarly, in the case of Mutual Fund, income distribution tax is paid on the income distributed net of taxes.  I propose to remove this anomaly both in the case of the company and the Mutual Fund.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"207.Currently, where an assessee fails to deduct and pay tax on specified payments to residents, 100 percent of such payments are not allowed as deduction while computing his income.  This has caused undue hardship to taxpayers, particularly where the rate of tax is only 1 to 10%.  Hence, I propose to provide that instead of 100 percent, only 30% of such payments will be disallowed.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"208.The Direct Taxes Code Bill, 2010 has lapsed with the dissolution of the 15th Lok Sabha.  Having considered the report of the Standing Committee on Finance and the views expressed by the stakeholders, my predecessor had placed a revised Code in the public domain in March, 2014.  The Government shall consider the comments received from the stakeholders on the revised Code.  The Government will also review the DTC in its present shape and take a view in the whole matter. ",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,209.Income-tax Department is expected to function not only as an enforcement agency but also as a facilitator.  A number of Aykar Seva Kendras (ASK) have been opened in different parts of the country.  I propose to extend this facility by opening 60 more such Seva Kendras during the current financial year to promote excellence in service delivery.  ,,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"210.The focus of any tax administration is to broaden the tax base. Our policy thrust is to adopt non intrusive methods to achieve this objective. In this direction, I propose to make greater use of information technology techniques.  ",,,,,

2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"216.Cathode ray TVs are used by weaker sections who cannot afford to buy more expensive flat panel TVs. I propose to exempt colour picture tubes from basic customs duty to make cathode ray TVs cheaper. The duty concession will help revive manufacturing of TVs in the SME sector and create employment opportunities. At the same time, to encourage production of LCD and LED TVs below 19 inches in India, I propose to reduce the basic customs duty on LCD and LED TV panels of below 19 inches from 10 percent to Nil. Further, to encourage manufacture of LCD and LED TV panels, I propose to exempt from basic customs duty specified inputs used in their manufacture.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"217.The domestic stainless steel industry is presently suffering from severe under-utilization of capacity.

2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"221.I have also undertaken several tax rationalization measures. At present, coal attracts customs duties at different rates. I propose to rationalize the duty structure on all non-agglomerated coal at 2.5 percent basic customs duty and 2 percent CVD. Henceforth, anthracite coal, bituminous coal, coking coal, steam coal and other coal will attract the same duty. This will eliminate all assessment disputes and transaction costs associated with testing of various parameters of coal.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,222.Metallurgical coke is manufactured out of coking coal. The basic customs duty on metallurgical coke is being increased from Nil to 2.5 percent in line with the duty on coking coal.,,,,,

We expect the industry to show positive results in the coming months.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"230.In continuation, I have a few more proposals to boost domestic production. Minimization of harvest and post harvest losses of agricultural produce is an important measure for tackling food inflation and ensuring food security.

Footwear of retail price up to ` 500 per pair will continue to remain exempted.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"232.I propose to withdraw the concessional excise duty (2 percent without Cenvat benefit and 6 percent with Cenvat benefit) on smart cards and levy a uniform excise duty at 12 percent. Consequently, imports will attract higher CVD. This will help domestic industry.",,,,,

The twin objectives in this sector of indirect taxes are to widen the tax base and enhance compliance. My proposals in relation to Service Tax are in line with these objectives.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"240.To broaden the tax base in Service Tax, it is necessary to prune the negative list and exemptions to the extent possible. Accordingly, the negative list has been reviewed and service tax leviable currently, on sale of space or time for advertisements in broadcast media, is being extended to cover such sales on other segments like online and mobile advertising. Sale of space for advertisements in print media however would remain excluded from service tax. Similarly, tax is being proposed on the service provided by radio-taxis to place them on par with rent-a-cab service. These new levies will come into effect from a date to be notified after the passing of the Finance Bill.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"241.In furtherance of the effort to broaden the tax base, certain exemptions are being withdrawn, including those extended to services by air-conditioned contract carriages and technical testing of newly developed drugs on human participants.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"242.To spur growth in certain sectors, I have tried to correct the bottlenecks which have been brought to my knowledge. Indian shipping industry had been representing that they are losing business in a tough global scenario, due to a provision in the Place of Provision of Services Rules, which is now being addressed through an amendment. Similarly, to encourage growth in the transport of goods through coastal vessels, the tax incidence is being reduced. In response to the request of the tourism sector,  services provided by Indian tour operators to foreign tourists in relation to a tour wholly conducted outside India is being taken out of the tax net. A long standing demand of this sector has been to allow Cenvat credit for services of rent-a-cab and tour operators. I now propose to allow credit in the same line of business.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"243.I had to accept a few requests for exemptions from the social sector, since exemption-induced distortion would be comparatively less in such sectors. At the request of the Ministry of Agriculture, service tax on loading, unloading, storage, warehousing and transportation of cotton, whether ginned or baled, is being exempted to bring it on par with certain other agricultural produce. Services provided by the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation for the period prior to 1st July 2012 is being exempted.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"244.For the benefit of the common man, the exemption presently available for specified micro insurance schemes is being expanded to cover all life micro-insurance schemes where the sum assured does not exceed ` 50,000 per life insured. Since taxes should not come in the way of safe disposal of medical and clinical wastes, services provided by common bio-medical waste treatment facilities are being exempted.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,245.Certain changes are also proposed for bringing about greater clarity and for reducing litigation regarding the scope of exemptions. These include functions ordinarily entrusted to a municipality and services in relation to education.  ,,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"246.There are a few more decisions which entail small gains or losses of revenue. Certain amendments are also being proposed in the Customs and Central Excise Acts and in the Finance Act, 1994 relating to service tax. These changes are reflected in the budget documents.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"247.My tax proposals on the indirect taxes side are estimated to yield ` 7,525 crore.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,248.I have some more proposals which are in the nature of facilitating trade and resolving disputes. I shall highlight only a few.,,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"249.Faster clearance of import and export cargo reduces transaction costs and improves business competitiveness. To help achieve these objectives, measures are being initiated to extend the existing 24x7 customs clearance facility to 13 more airports in respect of all export goods and to 14 more sea ports in respect of specified import and export goods.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"250.It is also proposed to implement an ‘Indian Customs Single Window Project’ to facilitate trade. Under this, importers and exporters would lodge their clearance documents at a single point only. Required permissions, if any, from other regulatory agencies would be obtained online without the trader having to approach these agencies. This would reduce interface with Governmental agencies, dwell time and the cost of doing business.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,251.The scheme of Advance Ruling in indirect taxes is being expanded to cover resident private limited companies. This will allow these companies to seek advance ruling in respect of new activities being proposed to be undertaken by them. The scope of Settlement Commission is being enlarged to facilitate quick dispute resolution.,,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"252.To expedite the process of disposal of appeals, amendments have been proposed in the Customs and Central Excise Acts with a view to freeing appellate authorities from hearing stay applications and to take up regular appeals for final disposal.",,,,,
2014-15,Arun Jaitley,"253.Madam Speaker, with these words I commend the Budget to the House.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"Madam Speaker, ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,I rise to present the Budget of the Union for the year 2015-16. ,,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"2.I present this Budget in an economic environment which is far more positive than in the recent past. When other economies are facing serious challenges, India is about to take-off on a faster growth trajectory once again. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has downgraded its earlier forecast of global economic growth by 0.3%, and the World Trade Organization has revised its forecast of world trade growth from 5.3% to 4%.  Forecasts for India, however, have either been upgraded, or remained the same, without downgrades.  Madam Speaker, we have also embraced the States as equal partners in the process of economic growth.  States have been economically empowered more than ever before and it is my belief that every rupee of public expenditure, whether undertaken by the Centre or the States, will contribute to the betterment of people’s lives through job creation, poverty elimination and economic growth.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"3.In the last nine months, the NDA Government headed by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has undertaken several significant steps to energise the economy.  The credibility of the Indian economy has been re-established.  The world is predicting that it is India’s chance to fly. ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"Kuch to phool khilaye humne, aur kuch phool khilane hai",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"Mushkil yeh hai bag me ab tak, kaante kai purane hai",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"4.Though the Union Budget is essentially a Statement of Account of public finances, it has historically become a significant opportunity to indicate the direction and the pace of India’s economic policy.  My proposals, therefore, lay out the roadmap for accelerating growth, enhancing investment and passing on the benefit of the growth process to the common man, woman, youth and child: those, whose quality of life needs to be improved.  This is the path which we will doggedly and relentlessly pursue.  As the Prime Minister has often said, we are a round-the-clock, round-the-year Government. ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"5.Madam, allow me to describe the changes in the Indian economy since we first took office.  In November, 2012, CPI inflation, stood at 11.2%, the current account deficit by the first quarter of 2013-14 had reached 4.6% of GDP, and normal foreign inflows until March 2014 were $15 billion.  We inherited a sentiment of, if I may say so, doom and gloom, and the investor community had almost written us off.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"6.We have come a long way since then. The latest CPI inflation rate is 5.1%, and the wholesale price inflation is negative; the current account deficit for this year is expected to be below 1.3% of GDP; based on the new series, real GDP growth  is expected to accelerate to 7.4%, making India the fastest growing large economy in the world; foreign inflows since April 2014 have been about $55 billion, so that our foreign exchange reserves have increased to a record $340 billion; the rupee has become stronger by 6.4% against a broad basket of currencies; and ours was the second-best performing stock market amongst the major economies.  In short, Madam Speaker, we have turned around the economy dramatically, restoring macro-economic stability and creating the conditions for sustainable poverty elimination, job creation and durable double-digit economic growth. Domestic and international investors are seeing us with renewed interest and hope. ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"7.While being mindful of the challenges, Madam Speaker, this gives us reason to feel optimistic. With all the humility at my command, I submit that this opportunity has arisen because we have created it. The people of India had voted resoundingly for quick change, faster growth and highest levels of transparency. They wanted the scam, scandal and corruption Raj to end.  They wanted a Government in which they can trust. We have lived up to that trust. ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"8.Our actions have not been confined to the core or macro-economic areas alone.  Illustratively, action has been taken with regard to allocation of natural resources; financial inclusion; health and hygiene of the common man; girls and their education; employment for the youth; improved and non-adversarial tax administration; effective delivery of benefits; investment and job creation; welfare of labour; agricultural productivity and increasing farm incomes; power; digital connectivity; skilling our youth; efficient and better work culture in Government; ease of doing business; mainstreaming North Eastern States; and, reviving our pride in the nation and culture.  I am giving the details in an Annexure to this speech.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"9.Madam Speaker, of the work that we have done, I would like to talk of three achievements as they demonstrate the quality and conviction of our government.  One is the success of the Jan Dhan Yojana.  Financial inclusion has been talked about for decades now.  Who would have thought that in a short period of 100 days, over 12.5 crore families could have been brought into the financial mainstream?  The other is coal auctions.  Earlier, the States only got benefits of royalty. Now, by the transparent auction process that we are carrying out, the coal bearing States will be getting several lakh of crore of rupees which they can use for creation of long awaited community assets and for welfare of their people. ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"10.The third is ‘Swachh Bharat’ which we have been able to transform into a movement to regenerate India.  I can speak of, for example, the 50 lakh toilets already constructed in 2014-15, and I can also assure the Members of this august House that we will indeed attain the target of building six crore toilets.  But, Madam, Swachh Bharat is not only a programme of hygiene and cleanliness but, at a deeper level, a programme for preventive health care, and building awareness. ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"11.We are now embarked on two more game changing reforms.  GST and what the Economic Survey has called the JAM Trinity – Jan Dhan, Aadhar and Mobile – to implement direct transfer of benefits.  GST will put in place a state-of-the-art indirect tax system by 1st April, 2016.  The JAM Trinity will allow us to transfer benefits in a leakage-proof, well-targetted and cashless manner.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"12.Madam Speaker, one of the major achievements of my government has been to conquer inflation.  This decline, in my view, represents a structural shift.  Going forward, we expect CPI inflation to remain at close to 5% by the end of the year.  This will allow for further easing of monetary policy.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"13.To ensure that our victory over inflation is institutionalized and hence continues, we have concluded a Monetary Policy Framework Agreement with the RBI, as I had promised in my Budget Speech for 2014-15.  This Framework clearly states the objective of keeping inflation below 6%.  We will move to amend the RBI Act this year, to provide for a Monetary Policy Committee.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"14.The Central Statistics Office has recently released a new series for GDP, which involves a number of changes relative to the old series. Based on the new series, estimated GDP growth for 2014-15 is 7.4%.  Growth in 2015-16 is expected to be between 8 to 8.5%. Aiming for a double-digit rate seems feasible very soon.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"15.I now come to the task ahead of us. In respect of social and economic indicators, for seven decades now, we have worked in terms of percentages, and numbers of beneficiaries covered.  It is quite obvious that incremental change is not going to take us anywhere.  We have to think in terms of a quantum jump. ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"16.The year 2022 will be the Amrut Mahotsav, the 75th year, of India’s independence.  The vision of what the Prime Minister has called ‘Team India’, led by the States and guided by the Central Government, should include:",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,(i)A roof for each family in India.  The call given for ‘Housing for all’ by 2022 would require Team India to complete 2 crore houses in urban areas and 4 crore houses in rural areas.  ,,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"(ii)Each house in the country should have basic facilities of 24-hour power supply, clean drinking water, a toilet, and be connected to a road.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"(iii)At least one member from each family should have access to the means for livelihood and, employment or economic opportunity, to improve his or her lot.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,(iv)Substantial reduction of poverty.  All our schemes should focus on and centre around the poor. Each of us has to commit ourselves to this task of eliminating absolute poverty.,,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"(v)Electrification, by 2020, of the remaining 20,000 villages in the  country, including by off-grid solar power generation.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"(vi)Connecting each of the 1,78,000 unconnected habitations by all weather roads.  This will require completing 1,00,000 km of roads currently under construction plus sanctioning and building another 1,00,000 km of road.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"(vii)Good health is a necessity for both quality of life, and a person’s productivity and ability to support his or her family.  Providing medical services in each village and city is absolutely essential.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"(viii)Educating and skilling our youth to enable them to get employment is the altar before which we must all bow.  To ensure that there is a senior secondary school within 5 km reach of each child, we need to upgrade over 80,000 secondary schools and add or upgrade 75,000 junior/middle, to the senior secondary level.  We also have to ensure that education improves in terms of quality and learning outcomes.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"(ix)Increase in agricultural productivity and realization of reasonable prices for agricultural production is essential for the welfare of rural areas.  We should commit to increasing the irrigated area, improving the efficiency of existing irrigation systems, promoting agro-based industry for value addition and increasing farm incomes, and reasonable prices for farm produce.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"(x)In terms of communication, the rural and urban divide should no longer be acceptable to us.  We have to ensure connectivity to all the villages without it.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"(xi)Two-thirds of our population is below 35.  To ensure that our young get proper jobs, we have to aim to make India the manufacturing hub of the world.  The Skill India and the Make in India programmes are aimed at doing this.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"(xii)We also have to encourage and grow the spirit of entrepreneurship in India and support new start-ups.  Thus can our youth turn from being job-seekers, to job-creators.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,(xiii)The Eastern and North Eastern regions of our country are lagging behind in development on many fronts. We need to ensure that they are on par with the rest of the country.,,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"17.By the time of the 75th year of Indian independence, Amrut Mahotsav of our independence is reached, we have to achieve all of the above, so that India becomes a prosperous  country; and a responsible global power.  This will be our true and meaningful tribute to our freedom fighters.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,Major Challenges Ahead,,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"18.As I stated earlier, Madam Speaker, I am also mindful of the five major challenges I have to reckon with.  Firstly, Agricultural incomes are under stress.  Our second challenge is increasing investment in infrastructure.  With private investment in infrastructure via the public private partnership (PPP) model still weak, public investment needs to step in, to catalyse investment.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"19.Our third major challenge is that manufacturing has declined from 18% to 17% of GDP as per new GDP data; and manufacturing exports have remained stagnant at about 10% of GDP.  The Make in India programme is aimed at meeting this challenge, thus creating jobs.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"20.Fourth, we need to be mindful of the need for fiscal discipline in spite of rising demands for public investment. In keeping with the true spirit of co-operative federalism, we have devolved a 42% share of the divisible pool of taxes to States.  As members of this august House are aware, this is an unprecedented increase which would empower states with more resources. The devolution to the States would be of the order of `5.24 lakh crore in 2015-16 as against the devolution of `3.38 lakh crore as per revised estimates of 2014-15.  Another `3.04 lakh crore would be transferred by way of grants and plan transfers.  Thus, total transfer to the States will be about 62% of the total tax receipts of the country.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"21.In spite of the consequential reduced fiscal space for the Centre, the Government has decided to continue supporting important national priorities such as agriculture, education, health, MGNREGA, and rural infrastructure including roads.  Programmes targeted for the poor and the under-privileged, will be continued by us.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"22.With fiscal space not just reduced but squeezed, I have to meet the fifth challenge of maintaining fiscal discipline.    Economic growth this year, at 11.5%, was lower in nominal terms by about 2%, due to lower inflation.  Consequently, tax buoyancy was also significantly lower.  Despite this, Madam, I have kept my word, and we will meet the challenging fiscal deficit target of 4.1% of GDP, that we had inherited.  Madam Speaker, I need to overcome these challenges to reduce and eliminate poverty.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,Fiscal Roadmap,,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"23.I want to underscore that my government still remains firm on achieving the medium term target of 3% of GDP.  But that journey has to take account of the need to increase public investment.  The total additional public investment over and above the RE is planned to be `1.25 lakh crore out of which `70,000 crore would be capital expenditure from budgetary outlays.  We also have to take into account the drastically reduced fiscal space; uncertainties that implementation of GST will create; and the likely burden from the report of the 7th Pay Commission.  Rushing into, or insisting on, a pre-set time-table for fiscal consolidation pro-cyclically would, in my opinion, not be pro-growth.  With the economy improving, the pressure for accelerated fiscal consolidation too has decreased.  In these circumstances, I will complete the journey to a fiscal deficit of 3% in 3 years, rather than the two years envisaged previously.  Thus, for the next three years, my targets are: 3.9%, for 2015-16; 3.5% for",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"2016-17; and, 3.0% for 2017-18.  The additional fiscal space will go towards funding infrastructure investment. ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"24.I am moving amendments accordingly, in the Finance Bill, to the FRBM Act. ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"25. Madam Speaker, I want to round up the discussion on the fiscal road map on an optimistic note.  While there is a compositional shift, the aggregate envelope for job creation, poverty elimination and building infrastructure is not disturbed; in fact it goes up this year, and every subsequent year, in the same proportion as the tax revenues of the Union, and the State Governments increase.  From this national perspective of public finances, not only is the path to fiscal consolidation on track, aggregate annual capital expenditure of the Governments, as a whole, can be expected to rise  significantly, by more than 0.5% of GDP.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"26.Madam Speaker, it may be noted that the budget reflects considerable scaling up of disinvestment figures.  This will include both disinvestment in loss making units, and some strategic disinvestment.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,Good Governance ,,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"27.Madam, Speaker, this Government is committed in its resolve, as Indians, to regain our pre-eminence as a just and compassionate country.  Well-intentioned schemes  introduced in the past, have often been ill-targeted, riddled with leakages and delivered with inefficiency.  The same is true of subsidies.  Subsidies are needed for the poor and those less well off. What we need is a well targeted system of subsidy delivery. We need to cut subsidy leakages, not subsidies themselves.We are committed to the process of rationalizing subsidies based on this approach.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"28.We have embarked on that path.  The direct transfer of benefits, started mostly in scholarship schemes, will be further expanded with a view to increasing the number of beneficiaries from the present 1 crore to 10.3 crore.  Similarly, `6,335 crore have so far been transferred directly, as LPG subsidy to 11.5 crore LPG consumers.  I am sure, persons who are better-off, such as those in the top tax bracket, and those genuinely concerned for the welfare of the poor, such as members of this House, will give up their LPG subsidy voluntarily.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,Agriculture ,,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"29.Our commitment to farmers runs deep.  We have already taken major steps to address the two major factors critical to agricultural production: soil and water.  An ambitious Soil Health Card Scheme has been launched to improve soil fertility on a sustainable basis.  In order to improve soil health, I also propose to support Agiculture Ministry’s organic farming scheme – “Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana”.  The Pradhanmantri Gram Sinchai Yojana is aimed at irrigating the field of every farmer and improving water use efficiency to provide `Per Drop More Crop’.  I am allocating `5,300 crore to support micro-irrigation, watershed development and the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana.  I urge the States to chip in substantially in this vital sector.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"30.To support the agriculture sector with the help of effective and hassle-free agriculture credit, with a special focus on small and marginal farmers,",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"I propose to allocate `25,000 crore in 2015-16 to the corpus of Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) set up in NABARD; `15,000 crore for Long Term Rural Credit Fund;  `45,000 crore for Short Term Cooperative Rural Credit Refinance Fund; and `15,000 crore for Short Term RRB Refinance Fund.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"31.Farm credit underpins the efforts of our hard-working farmers.  I have, therefore, set up an ambitious target of `8.5 lakh crore of credit during the year 2015-16 which, I am sure, the banks will surpass.   ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"32.Our government is committed to supporting employment through MGNREGA. We will ensure that no one who is poor is left without employment. We will focus on improving the quality and effectiveness of activities under MGNREGA.  I have made an initial allocation of `34,699 crore for the programme.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"33.While the farmer is no longer in the clutches of the local trader, his produce still does not command the best national price. To increase the incomes of farmers, it is imperative that we create a National agricultural market, which will have the incidental benefit of moderating price rises.  I intend this year to work with the States, in NITI, for the creation of a Unified National Agriculture Market. ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,Funding the Unfunded ,,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"34.Madam Speaker, our government firmly believes that development has to generate inclusive growth. While large corporate and business entities have a role to play, this has to be complemented by informal sector enterprises which generate maximum employment. There are some 5.77 crore small business units, mostly individual proprietorship, which run small manufacturing, trading or service businesses.  62% of these are owned by SC/ST/OBC.  These bottom-of-the-pyramid, hard-working entrepreneurs find it difficult, if not impossible, to access formal systems of credit.  I, therefore, propose to create a Micro Units Development Refinance Agency (MUDRA) Bank,  with a corpus of `20,000 crore, and credit guarantee corpus of `3,000 crore.  MUDRA Bank will  refinance Micro-Finance Institutions through a Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana. In lending, priority will be given to SC/ST enterprises. These measures will greatly increase the confidence of young, educated or skilled workers who would now be able to aspire to become first generation entrepreneurs; existing small businesses, too,  will be able to expand their activities. Just as we are banking the un-banked, we are also funding the un-funded.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"35.A significant part of the working capital requirement of a MSME arises due to long receivables realization cycles.    We are in the process of establishing an electronic Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) financing of trade receivables of MSMEs, from corporate and other buyers, through multiple financiers.  This should improve the liquidity in the MSME sector significantly.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"36.Bankruptcy law reform, that brings about legal certainty and speed, has been identified as a key priority for improving the ease of doing business.   SICA (Sick Industrial Companies Act) and BIFR (Bureau for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction) have failed in achieving these objectives.  We will bring a comprehensive Bankruptcy Code in fiscal 2015-16, that will meet global standards and provide necessary judicial capacity.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"37.The Government is committed to increasing access of the people to the formal financial system.  In this context, Government proposes to utilize the vast Postal network with nearly 1,54,000 points of presence spread across the villages of the country.  I hope that the Postal Department will make its proposed Payments Bank venture successful so that it contributes further to the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"38.To bring parity in regulation of Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) with other financial institutions in matters relating to recovery, it is proposed that NBFCs registered with RBI and having asset size of `500 crore and above will be considered for notifications as ‘Financial Institution’ in terms of the SARFAESI Act, 2002. ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,From Jan Dhan to Jan Suraksha ,,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"39.A large proportion of India’s population is without insurance of any kind - health, accidental or life.  Worryingly, as our young population ages, it is also going to be pension-less.  Encouraged by the success of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, I propose to work towards creating a universal social security system for all Indians, specially the poor and the under-privileged.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"40.The soon-to-be-launched Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojna will cover accidental death risk of `2 lakh for a premium of just `12 per year. Similarly, we will also launch the Atal Pension Yojana, which will provide a defined pension, depending on the contribution, and its period. To encourage people to join this scheme, the Government will contribute 50% of the beneficiaries’ premium limited to `1,000 each year, for five years, in the new accounts opened before 31st December, 2015.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"41.The third Social Security Scheme that I wish to announce is the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana which covers both natural and accidental death risk of `2 lakhs.  The premium will be `330 per year, or less than one rupee per day, for the age group 18-50.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"42.There are unclaimed deposits of about `3,000 crore in the PPF, and approximately `6,000 crore in the EPF corpus.  I have proposed the creation of a Senior Citizen Welfare Fund, in the Finance Bill, for appropriation of these amounts to a corpus which will be used to subsidize the premiums of vulnerable groups such as old age pensioners, BPL card-holders, small and marginal farmers and others. A detailed scheme would be issued in March.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"43.Madam Speaker, special regard needs to be paid to the population of senior citizens in the country which is now approximately 10.5 crore, out of which over one crore are above the age of 80 years.  70% live in rural areas and a large number are in the BPL category.  A sizeable percentage of them also suffer from age related disabilities.  Ours is a society that venerates its elders.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"I, therefore, propose that a new scheme for providing Physical Aids and Assisted Living Devices for senior citizens, living below the poverty line.    ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"44.In sum, these social security schemes reflect our commitment to utilize the Jan Dhan platform, to ensure that no Indian citizen will have to worry about illness, accidents, or penury in old age. Being sensitive to the needs of the poor, under-privileged and the disadvantaged, my Government also remains committed to the ongoing welfare schemes for the SCs, STs and Women.  Despite serious constraints on Union finances, allocations made this year are as follows:",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"SC` 30,851 crore",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"ST` 19,980 crore",,,,,

2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"45.An integrated education and livelihood scheme called ‘Nai Manzil’ will be launched this year to enable Minority Youth who do not have a formal school-leaving certificate to obtain one and find better employment. Further, to show-case civilization and culture of the Parsis, the Government will support, in2015-16, an exhibition, ‘The Everlasting Flame’.  The allocation for the Ministry of Minority Affairs is being protected. The BE for the year 2015-16 is `3,738 crore.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,Infrastructure,,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"46.Madam, it is no secret that the major slippage in the last decade has been on the infrastructure front. Our infrastructure does not match our growth ambitions.  There is a pressing need to increase public investment.  I have, therefore, increased outlays on both the roads and the gross budgetary support to the railways, by `14,031 crore, and `10,050 crore respectively.   The CAPEX of the public sector units is expected to be ` 3,17,889 crore, an increase of approximately `80,844 crore over RE 2014-15. In fact, all told, investment in infrastructure will go up by `70,000  crore in the year 2015-16, over the year 2014-15 from the Centre’s Funds and resources of CPSEs.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"47.Secondly, I intend to establish a National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), and find monies to ensure an annual flow of ` 20,000 crore to it.  This will enable the Trust to raise debt, and in turn, invest as equity, in infrastructure finance companies such as the IRFC and NHB.  The infrastructure finance companies can then leverage this extra equity, many fold.  Thirdly, I also intend to permit tax free infrastructure bonds for the projects in the rail, road and irrigation sectors.  Fourth, the PPP mode of infrastructure development has to be revisited, and revitalised.  The major issue involved is rebalancing of risk. In infrastructure projects, the sovereign will have to bear a major part of the risk without, of course, absorbing it entirely.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"48.Fifth, I also intend to establish, in NITI, the Atal Innovation Mission (AIM).   AIM will be an Innovation Promotion Platform involving academics, entrepreneurs, and researchers and draw upon national and international experiences to foster a culture of innovation, R&D and scientific research in India. The platform will also promote a network of world-class innovation hubs and Grand Challenges for India.  Initially, a sum of ` 150 crore will be earmarked for this purpose.   ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"49.India has a well regarded and world-class IT industry with revenues of about US$ 150 billion, over US$ 100 billion of exports, employing nearly 40 lakh people directly.  We are now seeing a growing interest in start-ups.  Experimenting in cutting edge technologies, creating value out of ideas and initiatives and converting them into scalable enterprises and businesses is at the core of our strategy for engaging our youth and for inclusive and sustainable growth of the country. Concerns such as a more liberal system of raising global capital, incubation facilities in our Centres of Excellence, funding for seed capital and growth, and ease of Doing Business etc. need to be addressed to create lakh of jobs and hundreds of billion dollars in value. ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"50.With this objective, Government is establishing a mechanism to beknown as SETU (Self-Employment and Talent Utilisation).  SETU will be a Techno-Financial, Incubation and Facilitation Programme to support all aspects of start-up businesses, and other self-employment activities, particularly in technology-driven areas. I am setting aside ` 1,000 crore initially in NITI Aayog for this purpose.   ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"51.As the success of so-called minor ports has shown, ports can be an attractive investment possibility for the private sector.  Ports in the public sector need to both attract such investment as well as leverage the huge land resources lying unused with them.  To enable us to do so, ports in public sector will be encouraged, to corporatize, and become companies under the Companies Act.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"52.Madam Speaker, investors spend a large amount of time and resources on getting the multiple permissions required.  We aim towards ease of doing in India.  I have myself launched the e-Biz Portal which integrates 14 regulatory permissions at one source.  Good States are embracing and joining this platform.  However, if we really want to create jobs, we have to make India an investment destination which permits the start of a business in accordance with publically stated guidelines and criteria. ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,53.I intend to appoint an Expert Committee for this purpose to examine the possibility and prepare a draft legislation where the need for multiple prior permissions can be replaced with a pre-existing regulatory mechanism.  ,,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"54.The Government also proposes to set up 5 new Ultra Mega Power Projects, each of 4000 MWs in the plug-and-play mode.  All clearances and linkages will be in place before the project is awarded by a transparent auction system.  This should unlock investments to the extent of ` 1 lakh crore.  The Government would also consider similar plug-and-play projects in other infrastructure projects such as roads, ports, rail lines, airports etc. I am happy to announce that the second unit of Kudankulam Nuclear Power Station will be commissioned in 2015-16.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"55.Madam Speaker, I hope to garner some additional resources during the year from tax buoyancy.  If I am successful, then over and above the budgetary allocation, I will endeavour to enhance allocations to MGNREGA by ` 5,000 crore; Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) by ` 1,500 crore; Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS) by ` 500 crore; and the Prdhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana by ` 3,000 crore; and the initial inflow of ` 5,000 crore into the NIIF.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,Financial Markets,,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"56.One vital factor in promoting investment in India, including in the infrastructure sector, is the deepening of the Indian Bond market, which we have to bring at the same level as our world class equity market.  I intend to begin this process this year by setting up a Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA) which will bring both India’s external borrowings and domestic debt under one roof.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"57.I also propose to merge the Forwards Markets Commission with SEBI to strengthen regulation of commodity forward markets and reduce wild speculation. Enabling legislation, amending the Government Securities Act and the RBI Act is proposed in the Finance Bill, 2015.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"58.Capital Account Controls is a policy, rather than a regulatory, matter.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"I, therefore, propose to amend, through the Finance Bill, Section-6 of FEMA to clearly provide that control on capital flows as equity will be exercised by the Government, in consultation with the RBI.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"59.A properly functioning capital market also requires proper consumer protection.  I, therefore, also propose to create a Task Force to establish a sector-neutral Financial Redressal Agency that will address grievances against all financial service providers.  I am also glad to inform the House that work assigned to the Task Forces on the Financial Data Management Centre, the Financial Sector Appellate Tribunal, the Resolution Corporation, and the Public Debt Management Agency are progressing satisfactorily.  We have also received a large number of suggestions regarding the Indian Financial Code (IFC), which are currently being reviewed by the Justice Srikrishna Committee.  I hope, sooner rather than later, to introduce the IFC in Parliament for consideration.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"60.Madam, Speaker, this is just the beginning.  I have a vision of putting in place a direct tax regime which is internationally competitive on rates, is without exemptions, incentivises savings, and does not realize tax from intermediaries.  Such a direct tax regime would match the modernized indirect taxes regime we are putting in place by way of GST, and will bring both greater transparency and greater investments.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"61.Madam Speaker the situation with regard to the dormant Employees Provident Fund (EPF) accounts and the claim ratios of ESIs is too well known to be repeated here.  It has been remarked that both EPF and ESI have hostages, rather than clients.  Further, the low paid worker suffers deductions greater than the better paid workers, in percentage terms.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"62.With respect to the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), the employee needs to be provided two options. Firstly, the employee may opt for EPF or the New Pension Scheme (NPS).  Secondly, for employees below a certain threshold of monthly income, contribution to EPF should be optional, without affecting or reducing the employer’s contribution. With respect to ESI, the employee should have the option of choosing either ESI or a Health Insurance product, recognized by the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority (IRDA). We intend to bring amending legislation in this regard, after stakeholder consultation. ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,Monetising Gold,,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"63.India is one of the largest consumers of gold in the world and imports as much as 800-1000 tonnes of gold each year.  Though stocks of gold in India are estimated to be over 20,000 tonnes, mostly this gold is neither traded, nor monetized. I propose to:",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"(i)Introduce a Gold Monetisation Scheme, which will replace both the present Gold Deposit and Gold metal Loan Schemes.  The new scheme will allow the depositors of gold to earn interest in their metal accounts and the jewelers to obtain loans in their metal account.  Banks/other dealers would also be able to monetize this gold.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"(ii)Also develop an alternate financial asset, a Sovereign Gold Bond, as an alternative to purchasing metal gold.  The Bonds will carry a fixed rate of interest, and also be redeemable in cash in terms of the face value of the gold, at the time of redemption by the holder of the Bond.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"(iii)Commence work on developing an Indian Gold Coin, which will carry the Ashok Chakra on its face.  Such an Indian Gold Coin would help reduce the demand for coins minted outside India and also help to recycle the gold available in the country. ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"64.One way to curb the flow of black money is to discourage transactions in cash.  Now that a majority of Indians has or can have, a RUPAY debit card.  I, therefore,  proposes to introduce soon several measures that will incentivize credit or debit card transactions, and disincentivise cash transactions. ",,,,,

2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"65.Alternate Investment Funds Regulations have been notified by SEBI.  Such alternate investment funds provide another vehicle for facilitating domestic investments.

2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"66.To further simplify the procedures for Indian Companies to attract foreign investments, I propose to do away with the distinction between different types of foreign investments, especially between foreign portfolio investments and foreign direct investments, and replace them with composite caps  The sectors which are already on a 100% automatic route would not be affected.

2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"71.Madam, as environmental degradation hurts the poor more than others,  we are committed to make our development process as green as possible.  Our de facto ‘Carbon Tax’ on most petroleum products compares favourably with international norms.  With regard to coal, there is a need to find a balance between taxing pollution, and the price of power.  However, beginning this year, I intend to start on that journey too. My Government is also launching a Scheme for Faster Adoption and manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME).  I am proposing an initial outlay of `75 crore for this Scheme in 2015-16.  The Ministry of New Renewable Energy has revised its target of renewable energy capacity to 1,75,000 MW till 2022, comprising 100,000 MW Solar, 60,000 MW Wind, 10,000 MW Biomass and 5000 MW Small Hydro.",,,,,

I propose to set up an IIT in Karnataka, and upgrade Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad into a full-fledged IIT.  I also propose to set up a Post Graduate Institute of Horticulture Research and Education in Amritsar.  IIMs will be  setup in J&K and Andhra Pradesh.  In Kerala, I propose to upgrade the existing National Institute of Speech and Hearing to a University of Disability Studies and Rehabilitation.  I also propose three new National Institutes of Pharmaceutical Education and Research: in Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Chattisgarh; and an Institutes of Science and Education Research in Nagaland and Odisha.

I, therefore, propose to give similar special assistance to Bihar and West Bengal as has been provided by the Government of India in the case of Government of Andhra Pradesh.

2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"86.Defence of every square inch of our mother land comes before anything else.  So far, we have been over dependent on imports, with its attendant unwelcome spin-offs.  Our Government has already permitted FDI in defence so that the Indian-controlled entities also become manufacturers of defence equipments, not only for us, but for export.  We are thus pursuing the Make in India policy to achieve greater self-sufficiency in the area of defence equipment, including aircraft.  Members of this august House would have noted that we have been both transparent and quick in making  defence equipment related purchase decisions, thus keeping our defence forces ready for any eventuality.  This year too, I have provided adequately for the needs of the armed forces.  As against likely expenditure of this year of ` 2,22,370 crore the budget allocation for 2015-16 is ` 2,46,727 crore.",,,,,

2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"Madam Speaker,",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,94.I now turn to my tax proposals.,,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"95.Taxation is an instrument of social and economic engineering.  Tax collections help the Government to provide education, healthcare, housing and other basic facilities to the people to improve their quality of life and to address the problems of poverty, unemployment and slow development.  To achieve these objectives, it has been our endeavour in the last nine months to foster a stable taxation policy and non-adversarial tax administration.  A very important dimension to our tax administration is the fight against the scourge of black money.  A number of measures have already been taken in this direction. I propose to do much more.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,96.We need to revive growth and investment to ensure that more jobs are created for our youth and benefits of development reach millions of our poor.   We need an enabling tax policy for this.  I have already introduced the Bill to amend the Constitution of India for Goods and Services Tax (GST) in the last Session of this august House.  GST is expected to play a transformative role in the way our economy functions.  It will add buoyancy to our economy by developing a common Indian market and reducing the cascading effect on the cost of goods and services.  We are moving in various fronts to implement GST from the next year.  ,,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"97.We need to match this transformative piece of legislation in indirect taxation with transformative measures in direct taxation.  The basic rate of Corporate Tax in India at 30% is higher than the rates prevalent in the other major Asian economies, making our domestic industry uncompetitive.  Moreover, the effective collection of Corporate Tax is about 23%.  We lose out on both counts, i.e. we are considered as having a high Corporate Tax regime but we do not get that tax due to excessive exemptions.  A regime of exemptions has led to pressure groups, litigation and loss of revenue.  It also gives room for avoidable discretion.  I, therefore, propose to reduce the rate of Corporate Tax from 30% to 25% over the next 4 years.  This will lead to higher level of investment, higher growth and more jobs.  This process of reduction has to be necessarily accompanied by rationalisation and removal of various kinds of tax exemptions and incentives for corporate taxpayers, which incidentally account for a large number of tax disputes.   ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"98.I wanted to start the phased reduction of corporate tax rate and phased elimination of exemptions right away; but I thought it would be appropriate to give advance notice that these changes will start from the next financial year.  Our stated policy is to avoid sudden surprises and instability in tax policy.  Exemptions to individual taxpayers will, however, continue since they facilitate savings which get transferred to investment and economic growth.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"99.While finalising my tax proposals, I have adopted certain broad themes, which include:",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,A.Measures to curb black money;,,,,,

2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"100.Madam Speaker, the first and foremost pillar of my tax proposals is to effectively deal with the problem of black money which eats into the vitals of our economy and society.  The problems of poverty and inequity cannot be eliminated unless generation of black money and its concealment is dealt with effectively and forcefully.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"101.In the last 9 months several measures have been initiated in this direction.  A major breakthrough was achieved in October, 2014 when a delegation from the Revenue Department visited Switzerland and the Swiss authorities agreed to (a) provide information in respect of cases independently investigated by the Income-tax Department; (b) confirm genuineness of bank accounts and provide non-banking information; (c) provide such information in a time bound manner; and (d) commence talks with India for Automatic Exchange of Information between the two countries at the earliest.  Investigation into cases of undisclosed foreign assets has been accorded the highest priority, resulting in detection of substantial amounts of unreported income.  For strengthening collection of information from various sources domestically, a new structure is being put in place which includes electronic filing of statements by reporting entities.  This will ensure seamless integration of data and more effective enforcement.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"102.Tracking down and bringing back the wealth which legitimately belongs to the country is our abiding commitment to the country.   Recognising the limitations under the existing legislation, we have taken a considered decision to enact a comprehensive new law on black money to specifically deal with such money stashed away abroad.  To this end, I propose to introduce a Bill in the current Session of the Parliament.  ",,,,,

2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"(7)The offence of concealment of income or evasion of tax in relation to a foreign asset will be made a predicate offence under the Prevention of Money-laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA). This provision would enable the enforcement agencies to attach and confiscate unaccounted assets held abroad and launch prosecution against persons indulging in laundering of black money. ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,(8)The definition of ‘proceeds of crime’ under PMLA is being amended to enable attachment and confiscation of equivalent asset in India where the asset located abroad cannot be forfeited.,,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"(9)The Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA) is also being amended to the effect that if any foreign exchange, foreign security or any immovable property situated outside India is held in contravention of the provisions of this Act, then action may be taken for seizure and eventual confiscation of assets of equivalent value situated in India.  These contraventions are also being made liable for levy of penalty and prosecution with punishment of imprisonment up to five years. ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"104.As regards curbing domestic black money, a new and more comprehensive Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Bill will be introduced in the current session of the Parliament.  This law will enable confiscation of benami property and provide for prosecution, thus blocking a major avenue for generation and holding of black money in the form of benami property, especially in real estate. ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"105.A few other measures are also proposed in the Budget for curbing black money within the country.  The Finance Bill includes a proposal to amend the Income-tax Act to prohibit acceptance or payment of an advance of `20,000 or more in cash for purchase of immovable property.  Quoting of PAN is being made mandatory for any purchase or sale exceeding the value of `1 lakh.  The third party reporting entities would be required to furnish information about foreign currency sales and cross border transactions.  Provision is also being made to tackle splitting of reportable transactions.  To improve enforcement, CBDT and CBEC will leverage technology and have access to information in each other’s database. ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"106.Madam Speaker, the second pillar of my taxation proposals this year is job creation through revival of growth and investment and promotion of domestic manufacturing and ‘Make in India’.  I propose to undertake a series of steps in this direction to attract capital, both domestic and foreign.  Tax ‘pass through’ is proposed to be allowed to both Category-I and Category-II Alternative Investment Funds, so that tax is levied on the investors in these Funds and not on the Funds per se.  This will step up the ability of these Funds to mobilise higher resources and make higher investments in small and medium enterprises, infrastructure and social projects and provide the much required private equity to new ventures and start-ups.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"107.A step was taken in the last Budget to encourage Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and Infrastructure Investments Trusts (InvITs) by providing partial pass through to them.  These collective investment vehicles have an important role to revive construction activity.  A large quantum of funds is locked up in various completed projects which need to be released to facilitate new infrastructure projects to take off.   I therefore propose to rationalise the capital gains regime for the sponsors exiting at the time of listing of the units of REITs and InvITs, subject to payment of Securities Transaction Tax (STT).  The rental income of REITs from their own assets will have pass through facility.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"108.The present taxation structure has an inbuilt incentive for fund managers to operate from offshore locations. To encourage such offshore fund managers to relocate to India, I propose to modify the Permanent Establishment (PE) norms to the effect that mere presence of a fund manager in India would not constitute PE of the offshore funds resulting in adverse tax consequences.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"109.Implementation of the General Anti Avoidance Rule (GAAR) has been a matter of public debate.  The investment sentiment in the country has now turned positive and we need to accelerate this momentum.  There are also certain contentious issues relating to GAAR which need to be resolved.  It has therefore been decided to defer the applicability of GAAR by two years.   Further, it has also been decided that when implemented, GAAR would apply prospectively to investments made on or after 01.04.2017.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"110.Today I see a lot of young entrepreneurs running business ventures or wanting to start new ones.  They need latest technology.  Therefore, to facilitate technology inflow to small businesses at low costs, I propose to reduce the rate of income tax on royalty and fees for technical services from 25% to 10%.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"111.To generate greater employment opportunities, it is proposed to extend the benefit of deduction for employment of new regular workmen to all business entities.  The eligibility threshold of minimum 100 regular workmen is being reduced to fifty.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"112.The role of indirect taxes is also very important in the context of promotion of domestic manufacturing and Make in India.  In indirect taxes, therefore, I propose to reduce the rates of basic customs duty on certain inputs, raw materials, intermediates and components (in all 22 items) so as to minimise the impact of duty inversion and reduce the manufacturing cost in several sectors.   Some other changes address the problem of CENVAT credit accumulation due to the levy of SAD.  I propose to fully exempt all goods, except populated printed circuit boards for use in manufacture of ITA bound items from SAD and reduce the SAD on imports of certain other inputs and raw materials subject to actual user condition. These changes are detailed in the Annexure to the Budget Speech.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"113.My next proposal is regarding minimum government and maximum governance with focus on ease of doing business and simplification of Tax Procedures without compromising on tax revenues.  The total wealth tax collection in the country was `1,008 crore in 2013-14.  Should a tax which leads to high cost of collection and a low yield be continued or should it be replaced with a low cost and higher yield tax?  The rich and wealthy must pay more tax than the less affluent ones.  I have therefore decided to abolish the wealth tax and replace it with an additional surcharge of 2% on the super-rich with a taxable income of over `1 crore.  This will lead to tax simplification and enable the Department to focus more on ensuring tax compliance and widening the tax base. As against a tax sacrifice of `1,008 crore, through these measures the Department would be collecting about `9,000 crore from the 2% additional surcharge.  Further, to track the wealth held by individuals and entities, the information regarding the assets which are currently required to be furnished in wealth-tax return will be captured in the income tax returns.  This will ensure that the abolition of wealth tax does not lead to escape of any income from the tax net.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"114.The provision relating to indirect transfers in the Income-tax Act which is a legacy from the previous government contains several ambiguities.   This provision is being suitably cleaned up. Further, concerns regarding applicability of indirect transfer provisions to dividends paid by foreign companies to their shareholders will be addressed by the Central Board of Direct Taxes through a clarificatory circular.  These changes would eliminate the scope for discretionary exercise of power and provide a hassle free structure to the taxpayers. I reiterate what I had said in the last Budget that ordinarily retrospective tax provisions adversely impact the stability and predictability of the taxation regime and resort to such provisions shall be avoided.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"115.Further, to reduce the associated hassles to smaller taxpayers and the compliance costs in domestic transfer pricing, I propose to increase the threshold limit from `5 crore to `20 crore.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"116.In order to rationalise the MAT provisions for FIIs, profits corresponding to their income from capital gains on transactions in securities which are liable to tax at a lower rate, shall not be subject to MAT.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,117.The Tax Administration Reform Commission (TARC) has given a number of recommendations to improve the administration in the Tax Departments.  These recommendations are in advanced stage of examination and will be appropriately implemented during the course of this year.,,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"118.As part of the movement towards GST, I propose to subsume the Education Cess and the Secondary and Higher Education Cess in Central Excise duty.  In effect, the general rate of Central Excise Duty of 12.36% including the cesses is being rounded off to 12.5%.  I also propose to revise the specific rates of Central Excise duty in certain other commodities, as detailed in the Annexure.  However, in the case of petrol and diesel such specific rates are being revised only to the extent of subsuming the quantum of education cess presently levied on them, keeping the total incidence of excise duties unchanged.  The ad-valorem rates of excise duty lower than 12% and those higher than 12% with a few exceptions are not being increased.  Some changes are also being made to excise levy on cigarettes and the compounded levy scheme applicable to pan masala, gutkha and certain other tobacco products.  ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"119.To give a boost to domestic leather footwear industry, the excise duty on footwear with leather uppers and having retail price of more than `1000 per pair is being reduced to 6%. ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"120.To further facilitate the ease of doing business, online central excise and service tax registration will be done in two working days.  The assessees under these taxes will be allowed to issue digitally signed invoices and maintain electronic records.  These measures will cut down lot of paper work and red tape. Time limit for taking CENVAT credit on inputs and input services is being increased from six months to one year as a measure of business facilitation.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"121.Introduction of GST is eagerly awaited by Trade and Industry.  To facilitate a smooth transition to levy of tax on services by both the Centre and the States, it is proposed to increase the present rate of service tax plus education cesses from 12.36% to a consolidated rate of 14%.   ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"122.Madam Speaker, cleanliness of households and clean environment are very important social causes.  The fourth pillar of my taxation proposals this year therefore relates to initiatives for the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.  In my direct tax proposals, I have proposed 100% deduction for contributions, other than by way of CSR contributions, to the Swachh Bharat Kosh.  A similar tax treatment is also proposed for the Clean Ganga Fund.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"123.In indirect taxes, I propose to increase the Clean Energy Cess from `100 to `200 per metric tonne of coal, etc. to finance clean environment initiatives.  Excise duty on sacks and bags of polymers of ethylene other than for industrial use is being increased from 12% to 15%.  It is also proposed to have an enabling provision to levy Swachh Bharat Cess at a rate of 2% or less on all or certain services if need arises.  This Cess will be effective from a date to be notified.  Resources generated from this cess will be utilised for financing and promoting initiatives towards Swachh Bharat.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,124.It is also proposed to exempt services by common affluent treatment plants from service tax.  The concessions from customs and excise duties currently available on specified parts for manufacture of electrically operated vehicles and hybrid vehicles are being extended by one more year i.e. up to 31.3.2016. ,,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"125.Madam Speaker, the fifth pillar of my taxation proposals this year is extension of benefits to middle class tax payers.  The proposals in this regard are as follows :",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"Increase in the limit of deduction in respect of health insurance premium from `15,000 to `25,000.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"oFor senior citizens the limit will stand increased to `30,000  from the existing `20,000.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"oFor very senior citizens of the age of 80 years or more, who are not covered by health insurance, deduction of  ` 30,000 towards expenditure incurred on their treatment will be allowed.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"The deduction limit of ` 60,000 towards expenditure on account of specified diseases of serious nature is proposed to be enhanced to `80,000 in case of very senior citizens.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"Additional deduction of ` 25,000 will be allowed for differently abled persons under Section 80DD and Section 80U of the Income-tax Act.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,The limit on deduction on account of contribution to a Pension Fund and the New Pension Scheme is proposed to be increased from`1 lakh to `1.5 lakh.,,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"To provide social safety net and the facility of pension to individuals, an additional deduction of ` 50,000 is proposed to be provided for contribution to the New Pension Scheme under Section 80CCD.  This will enable India to become a pensioned society instead of a pensionless society.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,Investments in Sukanya Samriddhi Scheme is already eligible for deduction under Section 80C.  All payments to the beneficiaries including interest payment on deposit will also be fully exempt.,,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"Transport allowance exemption is being increased from `800 to `1,600 per month.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"For the benefit of senior citizens, service tax exemption will be provided on Varishta Bima Yojana.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"126.Madam Speaker, I am giving these concessions to individual taxpayers despite inadequate fiscal space.  After taking into account the tax concession given to middle class tax payers in my last Budget and this Budget, today an individual tax payer will get tax benefit of `4,44,200 as detailed in the annexure.  As and when my fiscal capacity improves, individual taxpayers will have a lot to look forward to. ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"127.Madam Speaker, there are several stand-alone proposals relating to taxation.  These include conversion of existing excise duty on petrol and diesel to the extent of `4 per litre into Road Cess to fund investment in roads and other infrastructure.  An additional sum of ` 40,000 crore will be made available through this measure for these sectors.  In service tax, exemption is being extended to certain pre cold storage services in relation to fruits and vegetables so as to incentivise value addition in this crucial sector.  The Negative List under service tax is being slightly pruned and certain other exemptions are being withdrawn to widen the tax base. ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"128.Yoga is India’s well acknowledged gift to the world.  It is proposed to include yoga within the ambit of charitable purpose under Section 2(15) of the Income-tax Act.  Further, to mitigate the problem being faced by many genuine charitable institutions, it is proposed to modify the ceiling on receipts from activities in the nature of trade, commerce or business to 20% of the total receipts from the existing ceiling of `25 lakh.  A national database of non profit organisations is also being developed.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"129.Enactment of a Direct Taxes Code (DTC) has been under discussion for quite some time.  Most of the provisions of the DTC have already been included in the Income-tax Act.  Among the very few aspects of DTC which were left out, we have addressed some of the issues in the present Budget.  Further, the jurisprudence under the Income-tax Act is well evolved. Considering all these aspects, there is no great merit in going ahead with the Direct Tax Code as it exists today.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"130.Madam Speaker, the details of direct and indirect tax proposals are given in the Annexure to the Budget speech and the other budget documents laid on the Table of the House.  My direct tax proposals would result in revenue loss of `8,315 crore, whereas the proposals in indirect taxes are expected to yield `23,383 crore.  Thus, the net impact of all tax proposals would be revenue gain of `15,068 crore.",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,CONCLUSION,,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"131.To conclude, Madam Speaker, it is no secret that expectations of this Budget have been high.  People who urge us to undertake Big Bang Reforms, also say that the Indian economy is a giant super tanker, or an elephant.  An elephant, Madam Speaker, moves slowly but surely.  Even our worst critics would admit that we have moved rapidly.  In this speech, I think I have clearly outlined not only what we are going to do immediately, but also a roadmap for the future. ",,,,,
2015-16,Arun Jaitley,"132.I think I can genuinely stake, for our Government, a claim of intellectual honesty.  We have been consistent in what we have said, and what we are doing.  We are committed, Madam Speaker, to achieving what we have been voted to power for:  Change, growth, jobs and genuine, effective upliftment of the poor and the under-privileged.  Our commitment to the ‘Daridra Narayan’ is steadfast, as is commitment to the Constitutional principles of Equality and Justice for All, without concern for caste, creed or religion.

2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"Madam Speaker,",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,I rise to present the Budget for the year 2016-17.,,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"I am presenting this Budget when the global economy is in serious crisis.  Global growth has slowed down from 3.4% in 2014 to 3.1% in 2015. Financial markets have been battered and global trade has contracted. Amidst all these global headwinds, the Indian economy has held its ground firmly.  Thanks to our inherent strengths and the policies of this Government, a lot of confidence and hope continues to be built around India.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"The International Monetary Fund has hailed India as a ‘bright spot’ amidst a slowing global economy. The World Economic Forum has said that India’s growth is ‘extraordinarily high’. We accomplished this despite very unfavourable conditions and despite the fact that we inherited an economy of low growth, high inflation and zero investor confidence in Government’s capability to govern.  We converted these difficulties and challenges into opportunities.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"Let us look at our achievements compared to the last three years of the previous Government when growth had decelerated to 6.3%.  The growth of GDP has now accelerated to 7.6%.  This was possible notwithstanding the contraction of global exports by 4.4% compared to 7.7% growth in world exports during the last three years of the previous Government. CPI inflation was at 9.4% during the last three years of the previous Government. Under our Government, CPI inflation has come down to 5.4%, providing big relief to the public.  This was accomplished despite two consecutive years of monsoon shortfall of 13%, compared to normal rainfall in the last three years of the previous Government.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,Our external situation is robust. The Current Account deficit has declined from 18.4 billion US dollars in the first half of last year to 14.4 billion this year. It is projected to be 1.4% of GDP at the end of this year. Our foreign exchange reserves are at the highest ever level of about 350 billion US dollars.,,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"Our initiatives in the last 21 months have not only placed the economy on a faster growth trajectory but have bridged the trust deficit, created by the previous Government.  We had to work in an unsupportive global environment, adverse weather conditions and an obstructive political atmosphere.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"We believe in the principle that money with the Government belongs to the people and we have the sacred responsibility to spend it prudently and wisely for the welfare of our people, especially the poor and the downtrodden. We have increased our Plan expenditure at the RE stage in 2015-16 in contrast to the usual practice of reducing it.  We achieved this despite adopting the Fourteenth Finance Commission recommendations which increased devolution to the States by 55%.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"We must now look ahead.  The risks of further global slowdown and turbulence are mounting.  This complicates the task of economic management for India.  It has three serious implications for us.  First, we must strengthen our firewalls against these risks by ensuring macroeconomic stability and prudent fiscal management.  Second, since foreign markets are weak, we must rely on domestic demand and Indian markets to ensure that India’s growth does not slow down.  And third, we must continue with the pace of economic reforms and policy initiatives to change the lives of our people for the better.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"We see these challenges as opportunities. The financial years 2015-16 and 2016-17 have been and will be extremely challenging for Government expenditure.  The 14th Finance Commission has reduced the Central share of taxes to 58% from the 68%.  In the financial year 2015-16, we managed to improve upon the budgeted expenditure due to revenue buoyancy, notwithstanding the steep reduction in the Central share of taxes. The next financial year 2016-17 will cast an additional burden on account of the recommendations of the 7th Central Pay Commission and the implementation of Defence OROP.  The Government, therefore, has to prioritise its expenditure.  We wish to enhance expenditure in the farm and rural sector, the social sector, the infrastructure sector and provide for recapitalisation of the banks.  This will address those sectors which need immediate attention.  Once the Government discharges these priority obligations, it shall then focus on other areas which are also of utmost priority to the Government.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"While increasing the outlay of various social sector programmes, the Government will undertake three major schemes to help the weaker sections of the society.  The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana has already been announced to protect the farmer from the adverse consequences of nature. The farmer will pay a nominal amount of insurance premium and get the highest ever compensation in the event of any loss suffered. A health insurance scheme which protects one-third of India’s population against hospitalisation expenditure is also being announced.  The Government is also launching a new initiative to ensure that the BPL families are provided with a cooking gas connection, supported by a Government subsidy. This will significantly improve the health of women and those BPL families who suffer adversely from the ill-effects of Chulha cooking.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"The Annual Budget is also an opportunity for the Government to outline its priorities for the year to come.  The priority of our Government is clearly to provide additional resources for vulnerable sections, rural areas and social and physical infrastructure creation.  The Government shall also endeavour to continue with the ongoing reform programme and ensure the passage of the Constitutional amendments to enable the implementation of the Goods and Service Tax, the passage of Insolvency and Bankruptcy law and other important reform measures which are pending before the Parliament.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"Additionally, as I will elaborate later, we will undertake significant reforms, such as the enactment of a law to ensure that all Government benefits are conferred upon persons who deserve it, by giving a statutory backing to the AADHAR platform;  bringing significant changes in the legislative framework relating to the transport sector so as to free it from constraints and restrictions; incentivising gas discovery and exploration by providing calibrated marketing freedom; enactment of a comprehensive law to deal with resolution of financial firms; providing legal framework for dispute resolution in PPP projects and public utility contracts; undertaking important banking sector reforms and public listing  of general insurance companies; and undertaking significant changes in FDI policy.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"Our agenda for the next year is, therefore, to ‘Transform India’ in this",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"direction. My Budget proposals are, therefore, built on this transformative agenda with nine distinct pillars.  These include:",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare:  with focus on doubling farmers’ income in five years;,,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,Rural Sector: with emphasis on rural employment and,,,,,

2016-17,Arun Jaitley,finances and delivery of benefits to the needy; and,,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,Tax Reforms: to reduce compliance burden with faith in the citizenry.,,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"In each of these themes, I shall outline specific policy measures and initiatives which would have a transformative impact on our economy and the lives of our people.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare,,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"Let me first take up Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare.  We are grateful to our farmers for being the backbone of the country’s food security. We need to think beyond ‘food security’ and give back to our farmers a sense of ‘income security’. Government will, therefore, reorient its interventions in the farm and non-farm sectors to double the income of the farmers by 2022.  Our total allocation for Agriculture and Farmers’ welfare is ` 35,984 crore.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,We need to address issues of optimal utilisation of our water resources; create new infrastructure for irrigation; conserve soil fertility with balanced use of fertilizer; and provide value addition and connectivity from farm to markets.,,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"Irrigation is a critical input for increasing agriculture production and productivity.  Out of 141 million hectares of net cultivated area in the country, only 46% is covered with irrigation.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,The ‘Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana’ has been strengthened and will be implemented in mission mode. 28.5 lakh hectares will be brought under irrigation under this Scheme.,,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"Implementation of 89 irrigation projects under AIBP, which have been languishing, will be fast tracked. This will help to irrigate 80.6 lakh hectares. These projects require `17,000 crore next year and `86,500 crore in the next five years. We will ensure that 23 of these projects are completed before 31st March, 2017.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"A dedicated Long Term Irrigation Fund will be created in NABARD with an initial corpus of about `20,000 crore.  To achieve all these, a total provision of `12,517 crore has been made through budgetary support and market borrowings in 2016-17.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"Simultaneously a major programme for sustainable management of ground water resources has been prepared with an estimated cost of `6,000 crore and proposed for multilateral funding.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,At least 5 lakh farm ponds and dug wells in rain fed areas and 10 lakh compost pits for production of organic manure will be taken up by making productive use of the allocations under MGNREGA.,,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"The Soil Health Card Scheme is now being implemented with greater vigour.  Through this, farmers get information about nutrient level of the soil and can make judicious use of fertilizers.  The target is to cover all 14 crore farm holdings by March 2017. `368 crore has been provided for National Project on Soil Health and Fertility. Besides, 2,000 model retail outlets of Fertilizer companies will be provided with soil and seed testing facilities during the next three years.  Fertilizer companies will also co-market city compost which increases the efficacy of chemical fertilizer. A policy for conversion of city waste into compost has also been approved by the Government under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"To increase crop yields in rain fed areas, which account for nearly 55% of the country’s arable land, organic farming is being promoted.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"Towards this end, the Government has launched two important schemes. First, the ‘Parmparagat  Krishi Vikas Yojana’ which will bring 5 lakh acres under organic farming over a three year period.  Second, the Government has launched a value chain based organic farming scheme called “Organic Value Chain Development in North East Region”.  The emphasis is on value",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,addition so that organic produce grown in these parts find domestic and export markets. A total provision of `412 crore has been made for these schemes.,,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,Incentives are being given for enhancement of pulses production. `500 crores under National Food Security Mission has been assigned to pulses.  The number of districts covered has been increased to 622.,,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,A national level competition will be held among 674 Krishi Vigyan Kendras with a total prize money of `50 lakh to improve the efficiency and performance of these Kendras.,,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,Access to markets is critical for the income of farmers.  The Government is implementing the Unified Agriculture Marketing Scheme which envisages a common e-market platform that will be deployed in selected 585 regulated wholesale markets. Amendments to the APMC Acts of the States are a pre-requisite to join this e-platform.  I am happy to inform that 12 States have already amended their APMC Acts and are ready to come on board.  More States are expected to join this platform in the coming year. The Unified Agricultural Marketing E Platform will be dedicated to the Nation on the birthday of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 14th April this year.,,,,,

2016-17,Arun Jaitley,We are implementing the Pradhan Mantri,,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"(PMGSY) as never before.  This Scheme had suffered in the past because of underfunding.   The allocations in 2012-13 and 2013-14 were only `8,885 crore and `9,805 crore respectively. We have substantially increased the allocation in the last two years and have now allocated `19,000 crore in 2016-17. Together with States’ share, totally about `27,000 crore will be spent on this Yojana in 2016-17. Our goal is to advance the completion target of the programme from 2021 to 2019 and connect the remaining 65,000 eligible habitations by constructing 2.23 lakh kms of roads. Accordingly, the pace of construction which is currently 100 kms per day, as compared to the average of 73.5 kms during 2011-14, will be substantially stepped up.",,,,,

2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"Special focus has been given to ensure adequate and timely flow of credit to the farmers.  Against the target of `8.5 lakh crore in 2015-16, the target for agricultural credit in 2016-17 will be an all-time high of `9 lakh crore. To reduce the burden of loan repayment on farmers, a provision of `15,000 crore has been made in the BE 2016-17 towards interest subvention.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"Government has approved the path breaking Crop Insurance Scheme, namely, Prime Minister Fasal Bima Yojana.  For effective implementation of this Scheme, I have provided a sum of `5,500 crore in the Budget 2016-17.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"We have to ensure that the benefit of MSP reaches farmers in all parts of the country. Three specific initiatives will be taken up in 2016-17 for this. First, the remaining States will be encouraged to take up decentralized procurement.  Second, an online Procurement System will be undertaken through the Food Corporation of India.  This will usher in transparency and convenience to the farmers through prior registration and monitoring of actual procurement. Third, effective arrangements have been made for pulses procurement.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"Farmers also take up other allied activities to supplement their family income.

This is a quantum jump of 228% compared to the previous five year period.

Formation of Self Help Groups (SHGs) will be speeded up to promote multiple livelihoods.  Cluster Facilitation Teams (CFT) will be set up under MGNREGS to ensure water conservation and natural resource management.

2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"Swachh Bharat Mission is India’s biggest drive to improve sanitation and cleanliness, especially in rural India.  This subject was very close to the heart of the Father of the Nation.  For the first time since independence, the Parliament held a comprehensive debate on sanitation.  This has become a topic of discussion in almost every home.  We have introduced ranking of urban areas in sanitation which has resulted in constructive competition among towns and cities. ` 9,000 crore has been provided for Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.",,,,,

2016-17,Arun Jaitley,We need to derive greater benefit from our demographic advantage. We need to spread digital literacy in rural India.  Of the 16.8 crore rural households as many as 12 crore households do not have computers and are unlikely to have digitally literate persons.  We have already approved two Schemes to promote digital literacy: National Digital Literacy Mission; and Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (DISHA). We now plan to launch a new Digital Literacy Mission Scheme for rural India to cover around 6 crore additional households within the next 3 years.  Details of this scheme will be spelt out separately.,,,,,

I now proceed to present the key elements of my proposals in the Social Sector.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"In our country, cooking gas cylinders were considered an upper middle class luxury.  Gradually it spread to the middle class.  But the poor do not have access to cooking gas.

The time has come to remedy this situation.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"We have decided to embark upon on a massive mission to provide LPG connection in the name of women members of poor households.  I have set aside a sum of `2,000 crore in this year’s Budget to meet the initial cost of providing these LPG connections. This will benefit about 1 crore 50 lakh households below the poverty line in 2016-17. The Scheme will be continued for at least two more years to cover a total of 5 crore BPL households.  This will ensure universal coverage of cooking gas in the country.  This measure will empower women and protect their health. It will reduce drudgery and the time spent on cooking. It will also provide employment for rural youth in the supply chain of cooking gas.",,,,,

2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"Catastrophic health events are the single most important cause of unforeseen out-of-pocket expenditure which pushes lakhs of households below the poverty line every year.  Serious illness of family members cause severe stress on the financial circumstances of poor and economically weak families, shaking the foundation of their economic security.  In order to help such families, the Government will launch a new health protection scheme which will provide health cover up to Rs.One lakh per family.

With approximately 4,950 dialysis centres in India, largely in the private sector and concentrated in the major towns, the demand is only half met.

I have proposed an allocation of `55,000 crore in the Budget for Roads and Highways. This will be further topped up by additional `15,000 crore to be raised by NHAI through bonds.

2016-17,Arun Jaitley,VIII.Fiscal Discipline,,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,Let me now elaborate on the fiscal situation in the context of the Budget for the year 2016-17.,,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"While preparing this Budget, I have received conflicting suggestions about the FRBM roadmap.  Different schools of thought have argued either in favour of fiscal consolidation and stability or for a less aggressive consolidation and for boosting growth.   I have weighed the policy options and decided that prudence lies in adhering to the fiscal targets. Consequently, the fiscal deficit in RE 2015-16 and BE 2016-17 have been retained at 3.9% and 3.5% of GDP respectively. While doing so, I have ensured that the development agenda has not been compromised.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"The total expenditure in the Budget for 2016-17 has been projected at `19.78 lakh crore,  consisting of `5.50 lakh crore under Plan and `14.28 lakh crore under Non-Plan.   The increase in Plan expenditure is in the order of 15.3% over current year BE.  Plan Allocations have given special emphasis to sectors like agriculture, irrigation, social sector including health, women and child development, welfare of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, minorities, infrastructure, etc. Continuing with the policy of higher empowering States, the total resources being transferred to States are `99,681 crore more over RE 2015-16 and `2,46,024 crore more over Actuals of 2014-15. Details of allocations in certain vital sectors and schemes and transfers to States are given in Annex III to the Speech.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"This is the last year of the 12th Plan.  Successive committees have questioned the merit in having Plan and Non-Plan classification of Government expenditure.  A broad understanding over the years has been that Plan expenditures are good and Non-Plan expenditures are bad.  This results in skewed allocations in the Budget.  We need to correct this and give greater focus to Revenue and Capital classification of Government expenditure. We have, therefore, decided that the Plan-Non-Plan classification will be done away with from fiscal 2017-18.  The Finance Ministry will closely work with the State Finance Departments to align Central and State Budgets in this matter.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"To improve the quality of Government expenditure, every new scheme being sanctioned by Government will have a sunset date and outcome review. A redeeming feature of this year’s Budget is that we have improved upon the Revenue Deficit target from 2.8% to 2.5% of GDP in RE 2015-16.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"The FRBM Act has been under implementation for more than a decade.  Both Central and State Governments have made significant gains from the implementation of this Act.  There is now a school of thought which believes that instead of fixed numbers as fiscal deficit targets, it may be better to have a fiscal deficit range as the target, which would give necessary policy space to the Government to deal with dynamic situations. There is also a suggestion that fiscal expansion or contraction should be aligned with credit contraction or expansion respectively, in the economy.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"While remaining committed to fiscal prudence and consolidation, a time has come to review the working of the FRBM Act, especially in the context of the uncertainty and volatility which have become the new norms of global economy. I, therefore, propose to constitute a Committee to review the implementation of the FRBM Act and give its recommendations on the way forward.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"As the Honourable Members are aware, the Seventh Central Pay Commission has submitted its Report.

2016-17,Arun Jaitley,We have rationalised and restructured more than 1500 Central Plan Schemes into about 300 Central Sector and 30 Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  This will avoid overlapping of expenditure. I reiterate that I remain committed to the financial requirements arising from economic packages that have been announced by our Government and also commitments emanating from reorganisation of States.,,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,I have also allocated initial sums of `100 crore each for celebrating the Birth Centenary of Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay and the 350th Birth Anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh.,,,,,

In any case the effective rate of tax paid by companies comes to an average of 24.67 % because of various exemptions which they are availing of.   A phasing out plan of removing these exemptions and tax incentives was placed in public domain and we have received a large number of constructive suggestions. The final plan of phasing out exemptions is given in Annexure.  The highlights are as follows:-",,,,,

2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"The reduction in corporate tax rate   has to be calibrated with additional revenue expected from the incentives being phased out. The benefits from phasing out of exemptions are available to Government only gradually.   In the first phase, therefore, I propose the following two changes in corporate income-tax rates:-",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,The new manufacturing companies which are incorporated on or after 1.3.2016 are proposed to be given an option to be  taxed at 25% + surcharge and cess provided they do not claim profit linked or investment linked deductions and do not avail of investment allowance and accelerated depreciation.,,,,,

I propose to assist their propagation through 100% deduction of profits for 3 out of 5 years for startups set up during April 2016 to March 2019. MAT will apply in such cases.

2016-17,Arun Jaitley,Incentivising domestic value addition to help Make in India.,,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"136. Customs and excise duty structure plays an important role in incentivizing domestic value addition towards Make in India campaign of our Government.  In line with that, I propose to make suitable changes in customs and excise duty rates on certain inputs, raw materials, intermediaries and components and certain other goods and simplify procedures, so as to reduce costs and improve competitiveness of domestic industry in sectors like Information technology hardware, capital goods, defence production, textiles, mineral fuels & mineral oils, chemicals & petrochemicals, paper, paperboard & newsprint, Maintenance repair and overhauling [MRO] of aircrafts and ship repair etc.  Details of such changes are given in the Annexure to Budget Speech.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,Measures for moving towards a pensioned society,,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,Pension schemes offer financial protection to senior citizens.  I believe that the tax treatment should be uniform for defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.  I propose to make withdrawal up to 40% of the corpus at the time of retirement tax exempt in the case of National Pension Scheme.,,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"In case of superannuation funds and recognized provident funds, including EPF, the same norm of 40% of corpus to be tax free will apply in respect of corpus created out of contributions made after 1.4.2016.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"Further, the annuity fund which goes to the legal heir after the death of pensioner will not be taxable in all three cases.

2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna embodies the assurance of the Government to address the housing needs of all and more specifically the poor, in a time bound manner.  Construction of houses creates considerable employment opportunities as well. In order to fuel activity in the housing sector, I propose to give 100% deduction for profits to an undertaking from a housing project for flats upto 30 sq. metres in four metro cities and 60 sq. metres in other cities, approved during June 2016 to March 2019, and is completed within three years of the approval.

2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"Additional resource mobilization for agriculture, rural economy and clean environment",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) uniformly applies to all investors irrespective of their income slabs. This is perceived to distort the fairness and progressive nature of taxes. Persons with relatively higher income can bear a higher tax cost. I, therefore, propose that in addition to DDT paid by the companies, tax at the rate of 10% of gross amount of  dividend will be payable by  the recipients, that is, individuals, HUFs and firms receiving dividend in excess of `10 lakh per annum.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"I also propose to raise the surcharge from 12% to 15% on persons, other than companies, firms and cooperative societies having income above `1 crore.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"I also propose to collect tax at source at the rate of 1% on purchase of luxury cars exceeding value of Rs.ten lakh and purchase of goods and services in cash exceeding Rs.two lakh. For compliant tax payers with resources, this levy not only advances collection of tax when the expenditure is incurred, but it provides data to the tax authorities to identify the persons who incur such expenditure, but may be missing from the tax base.  Farmers and notified class of persons will have an option of giving a form by which TCS will not be charged.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,Rate of Securities Transaction tax in case of ‘Options’ is proposed to be increased from .017% to .05%.,,,,,

The levy will only apply to B2B transactions.",,,,,

2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"silver jewellery, other than studded with diamonds and some other precious stones], with a higher exemption and eligibility limits of ` 6 crores and ` 12 crores respectively.

2016-17,Arun Jaitley,Reducing litigation and providing certainty in taxation,,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"We are moving towards a lower tax regime with non-litigious approach.  Thus, while compliant taxpayers can expect a supportive interface with the department, tax evasion will be countered strongly.  Capability of the tax department to detect tax evasion has improved because of enhanced access   to information and availability of technology driven analytical tools to process such information. I want to give an opportunity to the earlier noncompliant to move to the category of compliant.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"I propose a limited period Compliance Window for domestic taxpayers to declare undisclosed income or income represented in the form of any asset and clear up their past tax transgressions by paying tax at 30%, and surcharge at 7.5% and penalty at 7.5%, which is a total of 45% of the undisclosed income. There will be no scrutiny or enquiry regarding income declared in these declarations under the Income Tax Act or the Wealth Tax Act and the declarants will have immunity from prosecution. Immunity from Benami Transaction (Prohibition) Act, 1988 is also proposed subject to certain conditions. The surcharge levied at 7.5% of undisclosed income will be called Krishi Kalyan surcharge to be used for agriculture and rural economy.  We plan to open the window under this Income Disclosure Scheme from 1st June to 30th September, 2016 with an option to pay amount due within two months of declaration.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"Our Government is fully committed to remove black money from the economy.  Having given one opportunity for evaded income to be declared once, we would then like to focus all our resources for bringing people with black money to books.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"Litigation is a scourge for a tax friendly regime and creates an environment of distrust in addition to increasing the compliance cost of the tax payers and administrative cost for the Government. There are about 3 lakh tax cases pending with the 1st Appellate Authority with disputed amount being 5.5 lakh crores.  In order to reduce this number, I propose a new Dispute Resolution Scheme (DRS).",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,A taxpayer who has an appeal pending as of today before the Commissioner (Appeals)   can settle his case by paying the disputed tax and interest up to the date of assessment. No penalty in respect of Income-tax cases with disputed tax up to ` 10 lakh will be levied. Cases with disputed tax exceeding ` 10 lakh will be subjected to only 25% of the minimum of the imposable penalty for both direct and indirect taxes.  Any pending appeal against a penalty order can also be settled by paying 25% of the minimum of the imposable penalty. Certain categories of persons including those who are charged with criminal offences under specific Acts are proposed to be barred from availing this scheme.,,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"I had in my Budget speech of July, 2014 assured that this",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"Government would not retrospectively create a fresh tax liability.  I had also hoped then that the cases pending in various courts and other legal fora relating to certain retrospective amendments undertaken to the Income-tax Act, 1961, through the Finance Act, 2012 will soon reach their logical conclusion.  I would like to reiterate that we are committed to provide a stable and predictable taxation regime. We will not resort to such amendments in future.  I had also announced constitution of a High Level Committee which would oversee any fresh case where the assessing officer proposes to assess or reassess the income in respect of indirect transfers by applying the retrospective amendment.  In order to allay any fears of tax adventurism, this Committee will now be chaired by the Revenue Secretary and consist of Chairman, CBDT and an expert from outside.  This Committee will effectively oversee the implementation of the assurances.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"In order to give an opportunity to the past cases which are ongoing under the retrospective amendment, I propose a one-time scheme of Dispute Resolution for them, in which, subject to their agreeing to withdraw any pending case lying in any Court or Tribunal or any proceeding for arbitration, mediation etc. under BIPA, they can settle the case by paying only the tax arrears in which case liability of the interest and penalty shall be waived.",,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,Levy of heavy penalty for concealment of income has over the years resulted in large number of disputes despite a number of decisions of the Apex court on interpretation of statutory provisions and principles guiding imposition of penalty.   At present the Income-tax Officer has discretion to levy penalty at the rate of 100% to 300% of tax sought to be evaded.  I propose to modify the entire scheme of penalty by providing different categories of misdemeanor with graded penalty and thereby substantially reducing the discretionary power of the tax officers. The penalty rates will now be 50% of tax in case of underreporting of income and 200% of tax where there is misreporting of facts.  Remission of penalty is also proposed in certain circumstances where taxes are paid and appeal is not filed.,,,,,
2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"Another issue which has led to considerable number of disputes is quantification of disallowance of expenditure relatable to exempt income in terms of Section 14A of the Income Tax Act.

2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"The Income-tax Department is also issuing instruction making it mandatory for the assessing officer to grant stay of demand once the assesse pays 15% of the disputed demand, while the appeal is pending before Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals).  In case of deviation, assessing officer has to get orders of his superiors.  The tax payer also has an option to go to superior officer in case he does not agree with conditions of stay order passed by the subordinate officer.",,,,,

2016-17,Arun Jaitley,"I also propose to amend the CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004, so as to improve credit flow, reduce the compliance burden and associated litigation, particularly those relating to apportionment of credit between exempted and non exempted final products/services.

2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"Madam Speaker, our Government was elected amidst huge expectations of the people. The underlying theme of countless expectations was good governance.  The expectations included burning issues like inflation and price rise, corruption in day to day transactions and crony capitalism. There was also expectation for a major change in the way the country’s natural resources were allocated, processed and deployed.",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"3.     In the last two and half years, it has been our mission to bring a Transformative Shift in the way our country is governed.  We have moved ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,from a discretionary administration to a policy and system based administration;  ,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,from favouritism  to transparency and objectivity in decision making; ,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,from blanket and loose entitlements to targeted delivery; and ,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,from informal economy to formal economy.,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"Inflation, which was in double digits, has been controlled; sluggish growth has been replaced by high growth; and a massive war against black money has been launched.  We have worked tirelessly on all these fronts and feel encouraged by the unstinted support of the people to our initiatives.  The Government is now seen as a trusted custodian of public money.  I take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the people of India for their strong support.",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"We shall continue to undertake many more measures to ensure that the fruits of growth reach the farmers, the workers, the poor, the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, women and other vulnerable sections of our society.   Our focus will be on energising our youth to reap the benefits of growth and employment.",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"Madam Speaker, I am presenting this Budget when the world economy faces considerable uncertainty, in the aftermath of major economic and political developments during the last one year.  Nevertheless, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that world GDP will grow by 3.1% in 2016 and 3.4% in 2017.   The advanced economies are expected to increase their growth from 1.6% to 1.9% and the emerging economies from 4.1% to 4.5%.   As per current indications, macro-economic policy is expected to be more expansionary in certain large economies. Growth in a number of emerging economies is expected to recover in 2017, after relatively poor performance in 2016.  These are positive signs and point to an optimistic outlook for the next year.",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"There are, however, three major challenges for emerging economies.  First, the current monetary policy stance of the US Federal Reserve, to increase the policy rates more than once in 2017, may lead to lower capital inflows and higher outflows from the emerging economies.  Second, the uncertainty around commodity prices, especially that of crude oil, has implications for the fiscal situation of emerging economies.  It is however expected that increase, if any, in oil prices would get tempered by quick response from producers of shale gas and oil.  This would have a sobering impact on prices of crude and petroleum.  Third, in several parts of the world, there are signs of increasing retreat from globalisation of goods, services and people, as pressures for protectionism are building up.  These developments have the potential to affect exports from a number of emerging markets, including India.  ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"Amidst all these developments, India stands out as a bright spot in the world economic landscape.  India’s macro-economic stability continues to be the foundation of economic success.  CPI inflation declined from 6% in July 2016 to 3.4% in December, 2016 and is expected to remain within RBI’s mandated range of 2% to 6%.  Favourable price developments reflect prudent macro-economic management, resulting in higher agricultural production, especially in pulses.  India’s Current Account Deficit declined from about 1% of GDP last year to 0.3% of GDP in the first half of 2016-17.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) increased from ` 1,07,000 crores in the first half of last year to ` 1,45,000 crores in the first half of 2016-17.  This marks an increase by 36%, despite 5% reduction in global FDI inflows.  Foreign exchange reserves have reached 361 billion US Dollars as on 20th January, 2017, which represents a comfortable cover for about 12 months of imports. ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley," The Government has also continued on the steady path of fiscal consolidation, without compromising on the public investment requirements of the economy. Externally, the economy successfully weathered a number of shocks, the redemption of FCNR deposits, volatility from the US elections and the Fed rate hike.   According to IMF forecast, India is expected to be one of the fastest growing major economies in 2017. ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"A number of global reports and assessments, over the last two years, have shown that India has considerably improved its policies, practices and economic profile.  These are reflected in Doing Business Report of the World Bank; World Investment Report 2016 of UNCTAD; Global Competitiveness Report of 2015-16 and 2016-17 of the World Economic Forum; and several other Reports.  India has become the sixth largest manufacturing country in the world, up from ninth previously.  We are seen as an engine of global growth.",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"In the last one year, our country has witnessed historic and impactful economic reforms and policy making.  In fact, India was one of the very few economies undertaking transformational reforms. There were two tectonic policy initiatives, namely, passage of the Constitution Amendment Bill for GST and the progress for its implementation ; and demonetisation of high denomination bank notes.  The advantages of GST for our economy in terms of spurring growth, competitiveness, indirect tax simplification and greater transparency have already been extensively discussed in both Houses of Parliament.  I thank all Members of both the Houses for having passed the Constitution Amendment unanimously.   I also thank the State Governments for resolving all relevant issues in the GST Council.   ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"Demonetisation of high denomination bank notes was in continuation of a series of measures taken by our Government during the last two years.  It is a bold and decisive measure.  For several decades, tax evasion for many has become a way of life.  This compromises the larger public interest and creates unjust enrichment in favour of the tax evader, to the detriment of the poor and deprived.   This has bred a parallel economy which is unacceptable for an inclusive society.  Demonetisation seeks to create a new ‘normal’ wherein the GDP would be bigger, cleaner and real. This exercise is part of our Government’s resolve to eliminate corruption, black money, counterfeit currency and terror funding.   Like all reforms, this measure is obviously disruptive, as it seeks to change the retrograde status quo.  Drop in economic activity, if any, on account of the currency squeeze during the remonetisation period is expected to have only a transient impact on the economy.  I am reminded here of what the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, had said: “A right cause never fails”. ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"Demonetisation has strong potential to generate long-term benefits in terms of reduced corruption, greater digitisation of the economy, increased flow of financial savings and greater formalisation of the economy, all of which would eventually lead to higher GDP growth and tax revenues. Demonetisation helps to transfer resources from the tax evaders to the Government, which can use these resources for the welfare of the poor and the deprived.  There is early evidence of an increased capacity of Banks to lend at reduced interest rates and a huge shift towards digitisation among all sections of society. We firmly believe that demonetisation and GST which were built on the third transformational achievement of our Government, namely, the JAM vision, will have an epoch making impact on our economy and the lives of our people.  ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"Madam Speaker, we are at an important turning point in the path of our growth and development.  ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"The pace of remonetisation has picked up and will soon reach comfortable levels.  The effects of demonetisation are not expected to spill over into the next year.  Thus IMF, even while revising India’s GDP forecast for 2016 downwards, has projected a GDP growth of 7.2% and 7.7% in 2017 and 2018 respectively. The World Bank, however, is more optimistic and has projected a GDP growth of 7% in 2016-17, 7.6% in 2017-18 and 7.8% in 2018-19. This pick up in our economy is premised upon our policy and determination to continue with economic reforms; increase in public investment in infrastructure and development projects; and export growth in the context of the expected rebound in world economy.  The surplus liquidity in the banking system, created by demonetisation, will lower borrowing costs and increase the access to credit.  This will boost economic activity, with multiplier effects. ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"The announcements made by Honourable Prime Minister on 31st December, 2016 address many of the key concerns of our economy at this juncture, such as, housing for the poor; relief to farmers; credit support to MSMEs; encouragement to digital transactions; assistance to pregnant women and senior citizens; and priority to dalits, tribals, backward classes and women under the Mudra Yojana.  ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"My overall approach, while preparing this Budget, has been to spend more in rural areas, infrastructure and poverty alleviation and yet maintain the best standards of fiscal prudence.  I have also kept in mind the need to continue with economic reforms, promote higher investments and accelerate growth.  ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"The last one year was a witness to other major reforms, namely, enactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code; amendment to the RBI Act for inflation targeting; enactment of the Aadhar bill for disbursement of financial subsidies and benefits; significant reforms in FDI policy; the job creating package for textile sector; and several other measures.  We will continue the process of economic reforms for the benefit of the poor and the underprivileged.  ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"Madam Speaker, the Budget for 2017-18 contains three major reforms.  First, the presentation of the Budget has been advanced to 1st February to enable the Parliament to avoid a Vote on Account and pass a single Appropriation Bill for 2017-18, before the close of the current financial year.  This would enable the Ministries and Departments to operationalise all schemes and projects, including the new schemes, right from the commencement of the next financial year.  They would be able to fully utilise the available working season before the onset of the monsoon.  Second, the merger of the Railways Budget with the General Budget is a historic step.  We have discontinued the colonial practice prevalent since 1924. This decision brings the Railways to the centre stage of Government’s fiscal policy and would facilitate multi modal transport planning between railways, highways and inland waterways. The functional autonomy of Railways will, however, continue. Third, we have done away with the plan and non-plan classification of expenditure.  This will give us a holistic view of allocations for sectors and ministries. This would facilitate optimal allocation of resources. ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"Madam Speaker, we are aware that we need to do more for our people. Continuing with the task of fulfilling the people’s expectations, our agenda for the next year is : “Transform, Energise and Clean India”, that is, TEC India.  This agenda of TEC India seeks to ",,,,,

2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"Clean the country from the evils of corruption, black money and non-transparent political funding.  ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,I propose to present my Budget proposals under ten distinct themes to foster this broad agenda.  The themes are :  ,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,Farmers : for whom we have committed to double the income in 5 years;,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,Rural Population : providing employment and basic infrastructure; ,,,,,

2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"Infrastructure:  for efficiency, productivity and quality of life;",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,Financial Sector : growth and stability through stronger institutions; ,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"Digital Economy :  for speed, accountability and transparency;",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,Public Service : effective governance and efficient service delivery through people’s participation;,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,Prudent Fiscal Management : to ensure optimal deployment of resources and preserve fiscal stability; and,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,Tax Administration : honouring the honest. ,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,FARMERS,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"The Indian farmer has once again shown his commitment and resilience in the current year.  The total area sown under kharif and rabi seasons are higher  than the previous year.  With a better monsoon, agriculture is expected to grow at 4.1% in the current year.  ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"In last year’s Budget speech, I focused on ‘income security’ of farmers to double their income in 5 years.  I had also announced a number of measures. We have to take more steps and enable the farmers to increase their production and productivity; and to deal with post-harvest challenges. ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"For a good crop, adequate credit should be available to farmers in time.  The target for agricultural credit in 2017-18 has been fixed at a record level of ` 10 lakh crores.  We will take special efforts to ensure adequate flow of credit to the under serviced areas, the Eastern States and Jammu & Kashmir.  The farmers will also benefit from 60 days’ interest waiver announced by Honourable Prime Minister in respect of their loans from the cooperative credit structure.",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"About 40% of the small and marginal farmers avail credit from the cooperative structure.  The Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS) act as the front end for loan disbursements. We will support NABARD for computerisation and integration of all 63,000 functional PACS with the Core Banking System of District Central Cooperative Banks.  This will be done in 3 years at an estimated cost of ` 1,900 crores, with financial participation from State Governments. This will ensure seamless flow of credit to small and marginal farmers.  ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"At the time of sowing, farmers should feel secure against natural calamities.  The Fasal Bima Yojana launched by our Government is a major step in this direction.  The coverage of this scheme will be increased from 30% of cropped area in 2016-17 to 40% in 2017-18 and 50% in 2018-19.  The Budget provision of ` 5,500 crores for this Yojana in BE 2016-17 was increased to ` 13,240 crores in RE 2016-17 to settle the arrear claims.  For 2017-18, I have provided a sum of ` 9,000 crores. The sum insured under this Yojana has more than doubled from ` 69,000 crores in Kharif 2015 to",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"` 1,41,625 crores in Kharif 2016.",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"Issuance of Soil Health Cards has gathered momentum.  The real benefit to farmers would be available only when the soil samples are tested quickly and nutrient level of the soil is known.  Government will therefore set up new mini labs in Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) and ensure 100% coverage of all 648 KVKs in the country.  In addition, 1000 mini labs will be set up by qualified local entrepreneurs.  Government will provide credit linked subsidy to these entrepreneurs. ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"A Long Term Irrigation Fund has already been set up in NABARD.  Honourable Prime Minister has announced an addition of ` 20,000 crores to its corpus.  This will take the total corpus of this Fund to ` 40,000 crores.",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"A dedicated Micro Irrigation Fund will be set up in NABARD to achieve the goal, ‘per drop more crop’. The Fund will have an initial corpus of `5,000 crores.",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"For the post-harvest phase, we will take steps to enable farmers to get better prices for their produce in the markets.  The coverage of National Agricultural Market (e-NAM) will be expanded from the current 250 markets to 585 APMCs.  Assistance up to a ceiling of ` 75 lakhs will be provided to every e-NAM market for establishment of cleaning, grading and packaging facilities.  This will lead to value addition of farmers’ produce.",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,Market reforms will be undertaken and the States would be urged to denotify perishables from APMC.  This will give opportunity to farmers to sell their produce and get better prices.,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,We also propose to integrate farmers who grow fruits and vegetables with agro processing units for better price realisation and reduction of post-harvest losses.  A model law on contract farming would therefore be prepared and circulated among the States for adoption.  ,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"Dairy is an important source of additional income for the farmers.  Availability of milk processing facility and other infrastructure will benefit the farmers through value addition.  A large number of milk processing units set up under the Operation Flood Programme has since become old and obsolete. A Dairy Processing and Infrastructure Development Fund would be set up in NABARD with a corpus of ` 8,000 crores over 3 years.  Initially, the Fund will start with a corpus of ` 2,000 crores.

2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"Over ` 3 lakh crores are spent in rural areas every year, if we add up all the programmes meant for rural poor from the Central Budget, State Budgets, Bank linkage for self-help groups, etc. With a clear focus on improving accountability, outcomes and convergence, we will undertake a Mission Antyodaya to bring one crore households out of poverty and to make 50,000 gram panchayats poverty free by 2019, the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji.  We will utilise the existing resources more effectively along with annual increases.  This mission will work with a focused micro plan for sustainable livelihood for every deprived household.  A composite index for poverty free gram panchayats would be developed to monitor the progress from the baseline. ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"Our Government has made a conscious effort to reorient MGNREGA to support our resolve to double farmers’ income. While providing at least 100 days employment to every rural household,  MGNREGA should create productive assets to improve farm productivity and incomes.  The target of 5 lakh farm ponds and 10 lakh compost pits announced in the last Budget from MGNREGA funds will be fully achieved.  In fact, against 5 lakh farm ponds, it is expected that about 10 lakh farm ponds would be completed by March 2017.  During 2017-18, another 5 lakh farm ponds will be taken up.  This single measure will contribute greatly to drought proofing of gram panchayats. ",,,,,

I have stepped up the allocation for Capital expenditure by 25.4% over the previous year. This will have multiplier effects and lead to higher growth.  The total resources being transferred to the States and the Union Territories with Legislatures is ` 4.11 lakh crores, against ` 3.60 lakh crores in BE 2016-17.

2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"The FRBM Review Committee has given its report recently.  The Committee has done an elaborate exercise and has recommended that a sustainable debt path must be the principal macro-economic anchor of our fiscal policy.  The Committee has favoured Debt to GDP of 60% for the General Government by 2023, consisting of 40% for Central Government and 20% for State Governments.  Within this framework, the Committee has derived and recommended 3% fiscal deficit for the next three years.  The Committee has also provided for ‘Escape Clauses’, for deviations upto 0.5% of GDP, from the stipulated fiscal deficit target.  Among the triggers for taking recourse to these Escape Clauses, the Committee has included “far-reaching structural reforms in the economy with unanticipated fiscal implications” as one of the factors.  Although there is a strong case now to invoke this Escape Clause, I am refraining from doing so.  The Report of the Committee will be carefully examined and appropriate decisions taken in due course.  ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"Nevertheless, I take note of the fiscal deficit roadmap of 3% recommended by the Committee for the next three years.  I have taken into consideration the need for higher public expenditure in the context of sluggish private sector investment and slow global growth.  I have kept in mind the recommendation of the Committee that a sustainable debt should be the underlying basis of prudent fiscal management.  Considering all these aspects, I have pegged the fiscal deficit for 2017-18 at 3.2% of GDP and remain committed to achieve 3% in the following year.  With this gradual approach, I have ensured adherence to fiscal consolidation, without compromising the requirements of public investment. ",,,,,

2017-18,Arun Jaitley,PART  B,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"Madam Speaker,",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,I shall now present my tax proposals:,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"India’s tax to GDP ratio is very low, and the proportion of direct tax to indirect tax is not optimal from the view point of social justice. I place before you certain data to indicate that our direct tax collection is not commensurate with the income and consumption pattern of Indian economy.  As against estimated 4.2 crore persons engaged in organised sector employment, the number of individuals filing return for salary income are only 1.74 crore.  As against 5.6 crore informal sector individual enterprises and firms doing small business in India, the number of returns filed by this category are only 1.81 crore.  Out of the 13.94 lakh companies registered in India upto 31st March, 2014, 5.97 lakh companies have filed their returns for Assessment Year 2016-17. Of the 5.97 lakh companies which have filed their returns for Assessment Year 2016-17 so far, as many as 2.76 lakh companies have shown losses or zero income.  2.85 lakh companies have shown profit before tax of less than ` 1 crore.  28,667 companies have shown profit between ` 1 crore to ` 10 crore, and only 7781 companies have profit before tax of more than ` 10 crores.",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,Among the 3.7 crore individuals who filed the tax returns in,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"2015-16, 99 lakh show income below the exemption limit of ` 2.5 lakh p.a., 1.95 crore show income between ` 2.5 to ` 5 lakh, 52 lakh show income between ` 5 to ` 10 lakhs and only 24 lakh people show income above ` 10 lakhs.  Of the 76 lakh individual assesses who declare income above ` 5 lakh, 56 lakh are in the salaried class. The number of people showing income more than ` 50 lakh in the entire country is only 1.72 lakh.  We can contrast this with the fact that in the last five years, more than 1.25 crore cars have been sold, and number of Indian citizens who flew abroad, either for business or tourism, is 2 crore in the year 2015.  From all these figures we can conclude that we are largely a tax non-compliant society.  The predominance of cash in the economy makes it possible for the people to evade their taxes.  When too many people evade taxes, the burden of their share falls on those who are honest and compliant.",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"After the demonetisation, the preliminary analysis of data received in respect of deposits made by people in old currency presents a revealing picture.  During the period 8th November to 30th December 2016, deposits between ` 2 lakh and ` 80 lakh were made in about 1.09 crore accounts with an average deposit size of ` 5.03 lakh.  Deposits of more than 80 lakh were made in 1.48 lakh accounts with average deposit size of ` 3.31 crores.  This data mining will help us immensely in expanding the tax net as well as increasing the revenues, which was one of the objectives of demonetisation. ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"Madam Speaker, one of the main priorities of our Government is to eliminate the black money component from the economy.  We are committed to make our taxation rates more reasonable, our tax administration more fair and expand the tax base in the country.  This approach will change the colour of money. ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"The net tax revenue of 2013-14 was ` 11.38 lakh crores.  This grew by 9.4% in 2014-15 and 17% in 2015-16.  As per the RE of 2016-17, we will end the year with a high growth rate of 17% for the second year in a row.  Because of the serious efforts made by the Government, the rate of growth of advance tax in personal income tax in the first three quarters of the current financial is 34.8%. ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"Madam Speaker, the thrust of my tax proposals in this Budget is stimulating growth, relief to middle class, affordable housing, curbing black money, promoting digital economy, transparency of political funding and simplification of tax administration.",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"In my budget proposals last year, I had announced a scheme for profit-linked income tax exemption for promoters of affordable housing scheme which has received a very good response.  However, in order to make this scheme more attractive, I propose certain changes in the scheme.  First of all, instead of built up area of 30 and 60 sq.mtr., the carpet area of 30 and 60 sq.mtr. will be counted.  Also the 30 sq.mtr. limit will apply only in case of municipal limits of 4 metropolitan cities while for the rest of the country including in the peripheral areas of metros, limit of 60 sq.mtr. will apply.  In order to be eligible, the scheme was to be completed in 3 years after commencement.  I propose to extend this period to 5 years. ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"At present, the houses which are unoccupied after getting completion certificates are subjected to tax on notional rental income.  For builders for whom constructed buildings are stock-in-trade, I propose to apply this rule only after one year of the end of the year in which completion certificate is received so that they get some breathing time for liquidating their inventory.",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"We also propose to make a number of changes in the capital gain taxation provisions in respect of land and building. The holding period for considering gain from immovable property to be long term is 3 years now.  This is proposed to be reduced to 2 years.  Also, the base year for indexation is proposed to be shifted from 1.4.1981 to 1.4.2001 for all classes of assets including immovable property.  This move will significantly reduce the capital gain tax liability while encouraging the mobility of assets. We also plan to extend the basket of financial instruments in which the capital gains can be invested without payment of tax. ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"For Joint Development Agreement signed for development of property, the liability to pay capital gain tax will arise in the year the project is completed.  ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"The new capital for State of Andhra Pradesh is being constructed by innovative land-pooling mechanism without use of the Land Acquisition Act. I propose to exempt from capital gain tax, persons holding land on 2.6.2014, the date on which the State of Andhra Pradesh was reorganised, and whose land is being pooled for creation of capital city under the Government scheme. ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,Measures for Stimulating Growth ,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,A concessional with-holding rate of 5% is being charged on interest earned by foreign entities in external commercial borrowings or in bonds and Government securities.  This concession is available till 30.6.2017.  I propose to extend it to 30.6.2020.  This benefit is also extended to Rupee Denominated (Masala) Bonds. ,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"The Government gave income tax exemptions to start-ups with certain conditions last year. For the purpose of carry forward of losses in respect of such start-ups, the condition of continuous holding of 51% of voting rights has been relaxed subject to the condition that the holding of the original promoter/promoters continues.  Also the profit linked deduction available to the start-ups for 3 years out of 5 years is being changed to 3 years out of 7 years.",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"Minimum Alternate Tax is at present levied as an advance tax.  There is a strong demand for abolition of MAT.  Although the plan for phasing out of exemptions will kick in from 1.4.2017, the full benefit of revenue out of phase-out will be available to Government only after 7 to 10 years when all those who are already availing exemptions at present complete their period of availment.  Therefore, it is not practical to remove or reduce MAT at present.  However, in order to allow companies to use MAT credit in future years, I propose to allow carry forward of MAT upto a period of 15 years instead of 10 years at present. ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"In my Budget proposals in 2015, I had announced that I would be bringing the corporate income tax rate down to 25% gradually.  In 2016 Budget, I had announced a reduction by 1% in case of those companies whose turnover is less than ` 5 crore.  In the same Budget, I had also announced that new manufacturing companies who do not avail of any exemption would be charged only 25% income tax. ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"Medium and Small Enterprises occupy bulk of economic activities and are also instrumental in providing maximum employment to people.  However, since they do not get many exemptions, they end up paying",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"more taxes as compared to large companies.  As per data of financial year 2015-16, 2.85 lakh companies making profit of less than ` 1 crore pay effective tax rate of 30.26% while 298 companies making profit above ` 500 crores pay effective tax rate of 25.90%.",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"In order to make MSME companies more viable and also to encourage firms to migrate to company format, I propose to reduce the income tax for smaller companies with annual turnover upto ` 50 crore to 25%.  As per data of Assessment Year 2015-16, there are 6.94 lakh companies filing returns of which 6.67 lakh companies fall in this category and, therefore, percentage-wise 96% of companies will get this benefit of lower taxation. This will make our MSME sector more competitive as compared to large companies.  The revenue forgone estimate for this measure is expected to be ` 7,200 crore per annum.",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"In order to give a boost to banking sector, I propose to increase allowable provision for Non-Performing Asset from 7.5% to 8.5%.  This will reduce the tax liability of banks.  I also propose to tax interest receivable on actual receipt instead of accrual basis in respect of NPA accounts of all non-scheduled cooperative banks also at par with scheduled banks. This will remove hardship of having to pay tax even when interest income is not realised.",,,,,

This benefit will be applicable for transactions undertaken in the current year also.",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"I propose to limit the cash expenditure allowable as deduction, both for revenue as well as capital expenditure, to ` 10,000.  Similarly, the limit of cash donation which can be received by a charitable trust is being reduced from ` 10,000/- to ` 2000/-.",,,,,

2017-18,Arun Jaitley,Transparency in Electoral Funding ,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"India is the world’s largest democracy.  Political parties are an essential ingredient of a multi-party Parliamentary democracy.  Even 70 years after Independence, the country has not been able to evolve a transparent method of funding political parties which is vital to the system of free and fair elections.  An attempt was made in the past by amending the provisions of the Representation of Peoples Act, the Companies Act and the Income Tax Act to incentivise donations by individuals, partnership firms, HUFs and companies to political parties.  Both the donor and the donee were granted exemption from payment of tax if the accounts were transparently maintained and returns were filed with the competent authorities.  Additionally, a list of donors who contributed more than `20,000/- to any party in cash or cheque is required to be maintained.  The situation has only marginally improved since these provisions were brought into force.  Political parties continue to receive most of their funds through anonymous donations which are shown in cash.",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"An effort, therefore, requires to be made to cleanse the system of political funding in India.  Donors have also expressed reluctance in donating by cheque or other transparent methods as it would disclose their identity and entail adverse consequences.  I, therefore, propose the following scheme as an effort to cleanse the system of funding of political parties:",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"In accordance with the suggestion made by the Election Commission, the maximum amount of cash donation that a political party can receive will be `2000/- from one person.",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,Political parties will be entitled to receive donations by cheque or digital mode from their donors.,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"As an additional step, an amendment is being proposed to the Reserve Bank of India Act to enable the issuance of electoral bonds in accordance with a scheme that the Government of India would frame in this regard.  Under this scheme, a donor could purchase bonds from authorised banks against cheque and digital payments only.  They shall be redeemable only in the designated account of a registered political party.  These bonds will be redeemable within the prescribed time limit from issuance of bond. ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,Every political party would have to file its return within the time prescribed in accordance with the provision of the Income-tax Act.  ,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"Needless to say that the existing exemption to the political parties from payment of income-tax would be available only subject to the fulfilment of these conditions.  This reform will bring about greater transparency and accountability in political funding, while preventing future generation of black money.",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,Ease of Doing Business ,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"As an anti-avoidance measure, the provision of domestic transfer pricing in respect of related entities was brought in the Finance Act of 2012.  Since then the number of entities being covered under domestic pricing has gone up substantially necessitating a longer scrutiny, which causes hardship to domestic companies.  In order to reduce the compliance burden due to domestic transfer pricing provisions, I propose to restrict the scope of domestic transfer pricing only if one of the entities involved in related party transaction enjoys specified profit-linked deduction.  ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"I propose to increase the threshold limit for audit of business entities who opt for presumptive income scheme from `1 crore to `2 crores.  Similarly, the threshold for maintenance of books for individuals and HUF is being increased from turnover of `10 lakhs to `25 lakhs or income from `1.2 lakhs to `2.5 lakhs. ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"In 2012, Income-tax Act was amended to provide for taxation of those transactions of transfer of shares or interest in a foreign entity deriving its value substantially from Indian assets.  Apprehensions have been raised about some difficulties which arise because of this provision in case of transfer of stake of investors of India-based funds located abroad but investing in India-based companies.  ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"In order to remove this difficulty, I propose to exempt Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) Category I & II from indirect transfer provision.  I also propose to issue a clarification that indirect transfer provision shall not apply in case of redemption of shares or interests outside India as a result of or arising out of redemption or sale of investment in India which is chargeable to tax in India.

2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"As on today, a TDS of 5% is being deducted from commission payable to individual insurance agents even if the income of some of them may be below taxable limit.

2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"Last year, I had announced a new scheme for presumptive taxation for professionals with receipt upto `50 lakhs p.a.  In respect of such assesses, they are being given further benefit in terms of paying advance tax in one instalment instead of four. ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"In order to allow the people to claim the refund expeditiously, the time period for revising a tax return is being reduced to 12 months from completion of financial year, at par with the time period for filing of return.  Also the time for completion of scrutiny assessments is being compressed further from 21 months to 18 months for Assessment Year 2018-19 and further to 12 months for Assessment Year 2019-20 and thereafter.",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"While the Government is trying to bring within tax-net more people who are evading taxes, the present burden of taxation is mainly on honest tax payers and salaried employees who are showing their income correctly.  Therefore, post-demonetisation, there is a legitimate expectation of this class of people to reduce their burden of taxation.  Also an argument is made that if a nominal rate of taxation is kept for lower slab, many more people will prefer to come within the tax net.  ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"I, therefore, propose to reduce the existing rate of taxation for individual assesses between income of `2.5 lakhs to `5 lakhs to 5% from the present rate of 10%.  This would reduce the tax liability of all persons below `5 lakh income either to zero (with rebate) or 50% of their existing liability.  In order not to have duplication of benefit, the existing benefit of rebate available to the same group of beneficiaries is being reduced to `2500 available only to assessees upto income of `3.5 lakhs.  The combined effect of both these measures will mean that there would be zero tax liability for people getting income upto `3 lakhs p.a. and the tax liability will only be `2,500 for people with income between `3 and `3.5 lakhs.  If the limit of `1.5 lakh under Section 80C for investment is used fully the tax would be zero for people with income of `4.5 lakhs.  While the taxation liability of people with income upto `5 lakhs is being reduced to half, all the other categories of tax payers in the subsequent slabs will also get a uniform benefit of `12,500/- per person. The total amount of tax foregone on account of this measure is `15,500 crores.",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"In order to make good some of this revenue loss on account of this relief, I propose to levy a surcharge of 10% of tax payable on categories of individuals whose annual taxable income is between `50 lakhs and `1 crore.  The existing surcharge of 15% of Tax on people earning more than `1 crore will continue.  This is likely to give additional revenue of `2,700 crores.  ",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"In order to expand tax net, I also plan to have a simple one-page form to be filed as Income Tax Return for the category of individuals having taxable income upto `5 lakhs other than business income.  Also a person of this category who files income tax return for the first time would not be subjected to any scrutiny in the first year unless there is specific information available with the Department regarding his high value transaction.  I appeal to all citizens of India to contribute to Nation Building by making a small payment of 5% tax if their income is falling in the lowest slab of `2.5 lakhs to `5 lakhs.",,,,,

2017-18,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"There has been substantial progress towards ushering in GST, by far, the biggest tax reform since independence. Since the enactment of the Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act, 2016, the preparatory work for this path-breaking reform has been a top priority for the Government. In this context, several teams of officers both from the States and Central Board of Excise and Customs have been working tirelessly to give finishing touch to the Model GST law and rules and other details. Government on its part has promptly given effect to various provisions of the Constitutional Amendment Act, including constitution of the GST Council. Since then, the GST Council held 9 meetings to discuss various issues relating to GST, including broad contours of the GST rate structure, threshold exemption and parameters for composition scheme, details for compensation to States due to implementation of GST, examination of draft model GST law, draft IGST law and the Compensation Law and administrative mechanism for GST. It is my privilege to inform this august house that the GST Council has finalised its recommendations on almost all the issues based on consensus and after spirited debate and discussions. The preparation of IT system for GST is also on schedule.  The extensive reach-out efforts to trade and industry for GST will start from 1st April, 2017 to make them aware of the new taxation system.",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"Centre, through the Central Board of Excise & Customs, shall continue to strive to achieve the goal of implementation of GST as per schedule without compromising the spirit of co-operative federalism.  Implementation of GST is likely to bring more taxes both to Central and State Governments because of widening of tax net.

This approach precisely reflects the strategy of Tax Department which is now formulated.  While revenue considerations always remain the focus of Revenue Department, we are trying to bring in maximum use of Information Technology to remove human contact with assesses as well as to plug tax avoidance.  We will try to maximise our efforts for e-assessment in the coming year.  We are also using a lot of data mining capability, both in-house and outsourced.  We plan to enforce greater accountability of officers of Tax Department for specific act of commission and omission. I would like to assure everyone that honest, tax-compliant person would be treated with dignity and courtesy. ",,,,,

2017-18,Arun Jaitley,"Presently institutions such as banks and insurance companies are categorised as Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) by SEBI.  They are eligible for participation in IPOs with specifically earmarked allocations. It is now proposed to allow systemically important NBFCs regulated by RBI and above a certain net worth, to be categorised as QIBs.  This will strengthen the IPO market and channelize more investments.",,,,,
2017-18,Arun Jaitley,Listing and trading of Security Receipts issued by a securitisation company or a reconstruction company under the SARFAESI Act will be permitted in SEBI registered stock exchanges.

2018-19,Arun Jaitley,I rise to present the Budget for 2018-19.,,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Madam, four years ago, we pledged to the people of India to give this nation an honest, clean and transparent Government.  We promised a leadership capable of taking difficult decisions and restoring strong performance of Indian economy.  We promised to reduce poverty, expedite infrastructure creation and build a strong, confident and a New India.  When our Government took over, India was considered a part of fragile 5; a nation suffering from policy paralysis and corruption.  We have decisively reversed this. The Government, led by Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, has successfully implemented a series of fundamental structural reforms. With the result, India stands out among the fastest growing economies of the world.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"The journey of economic reforms during the past few years has been challenging but rewarding. As a result of the reforms undertaken by the Government, foreign direct investment has gone up. Measures taken by the Government have made it much easier to do business in India.  Natural resources are now allocated in a transparent and honest manner.  There is a premium on honesty. There was a time when corruption was common-place. Today, our people, especially our youths, are curious to lead their lives honestly. The indirect tax system, with introduction of  Goods and Services Tax, has been made simpler. Benefits to the poor have been targeted more effectively with use of digital technology.  The demonetization of high value currency has reduced the quantum of cash currency and circulation in India.  It has increased the taxation base and spurred greater digitization of the economy.  The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has changed the lender-debtor relationship. The recapitalized banks will now have a greater ability to support growth. All these structural reforms in the medium and long run will help Indian economy achieve stronger growth for a long time. ",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Indian economy has performed very well since our Government took over in May, 2014.  India achieved an average growth of 7.5% in first three years of our Government.  Indian economy is now 2.5 trillion dollar economy – seventh largest in the world.  India is expected to become the fifth largest economy very soon.  On Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) basis, we are already the third largest economy.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Indian society, polity and economy had shown remarkable resilience in adjusting with the structural reforms. GDP growth at 6.3% in the second quarter signaled turnaround of the economy.  We hope to grow at 7.2% to 7.5% in the second half. IMF, in its latest Update, has forecast that India will grow at 7.4% next year.  Manufacturing sector is back on good growth path.  The services, mainstay of our growth, have also resumed their high growth rates of 8% plus. Our exports are expected to grow at 15% in 2017-18. We are now firmly on course to achieve high growth of 8% plus.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"We have taken up programmes to direct the benefits of structural changes and good growth to reach farmers, poor and other vulnerable sections of our society and to uplift the under-developed regions.  This year’s Budget will consolidate these gains and particularly focus on strengthening agriculture and rural economy, provision of good health care to economically less privileged, taking care of senior citizens, infrastructure creation and working with the States to provide more resources for improving the quality of education in the country.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has always stressed importance of good governance. He has articulated the vision of ‘‘Minimum Government and Maximum Governance’’.  This vision has inspired Government agencies in carrying out hundreds of reforms in policies, rules and procedures. This transformation is reflected in improvement of India’s ranking by 42 places in last three years in the World Bank’s ‘Ease of Doing Business’ with India breaking into top 100 for the first time.  I would like to congratulate all those who worked to achieve this.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Now, our Government has taken Ease of Doing business further by stress on 'Ease of Living' for the common men of this country, especially for those belonging to poor & middle class of the society. Good governance also aims at minimum interference by the government in the life of common people of the country.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Government is providing free LPG connections to the poor of this country through Ujjwala Yojana. Under Saubhagya Yojna 4 crore household are being provided with electricity connections. More than 800 medicines are being sold at lower price through more than 3 thousand Jan Aushadhi Centres. Cost of stents have been controlled. Special scheme for free dialysis of poor have been initiated. Persons belonging to poor and middle class are also being provided a great relief in interest rates on housing schemes. Efforts are being made to provide all government services, whether bus or train tickets or individual certificates on line. These include passports which may be delivered at doorstep in two or three days or Company registration in one day time and these facilities have benefited a large section of our country. Certificate attestation is not mandatory, interviews for appointment in Group C and Group D posts have been done away with. These measures have saved time and money of lakhs of our youth. Our Government by using modern technology is committed to provide a relief to those who suffer because of rigid rules and regulations.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Madam, while undertaking these reforms and programmes, we have worked sincerely and without weighing the political costs.  Our Government has ensured that benefits reach eligible beneficiaries and are delivered to them directly. Many services and benefits are being delivered to the people at their doorsteps or in their accounts. It has reduced corruption and cost of delivery and has eliminated middlemen in the process.  Direct Benefit Transfer mechanism of India is the biggest such exercise in the world and is a global success story. ",,,,,

2018-19,Arun Jaitley,Agriculture and Rural Economy,,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"My Government is committed for the welfare of farmers. For decades, country’s agriculture policy and programme had remained production centric. We have sought to effect a paradigm shift. Honourable Prime Minister gave a clarion call to double farmers’ income by 2022 when India celebrates its 75th year of independence. Our emphasis is on generating higher incomes for farmers.  We consider agriculture as an enterprise and want to help farmers produce more from the same land parcel at lesser cost and simultaneously realize higher prices for their produce. Our emphasis is also on generating productive and gainful on-farm and non-farm employment for the farmers and landless families.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Madam Speaker, as a result of the hard work of our country's farmers agriculture production in our country is at a record level. Doing the year 2016-17 we achieved a record food grain production of around 275 million tonnes and around 300 million tonnes of fruits and vegetables. ",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Madam Speaker, in our party's manifesto it has been stated that the farmers should realize at least 50 per cent more than the cost of their produce, in other words, one and a half times of the cost of their production. Government have been very much sensitive to this resolutions and it has declared Minimum support price (MSP) for the majority of rabi crops at least at one and a half times the cost involved. Now, we have decided to implement this resolution as a principle for the rest of crops. I am pleased to announce that as per pre-determined principle, Government has decided to keep MSP for the all unannounced crops of kharif at least at one and half times of their production cost. I am confident that this historic decision will prove an important step towards doubling the income of our farmers.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Our Government works with the holistic approach of solving any issue rather than in fragments. Increasing MSP is not adequate and it is more important that farmers should get full benefit of the announced MSP. For this, it is essential that if price of the agriculture produce market is less than MSP, then in that case Government should purchase either at MSP or work in a manner to provide MSP for the farmers through some other mechanism. Niti Ayog, in consultation with Central and State Governments, will put in place a fool-proof mechanism so that farmers will get adequate price for their produce.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"For better price realization, farmers need to make decisions based on prices likely to be available after its harvest. Government will create an institutional mechanism, with participation of all concerned Ministries, to develop appropriate policies and practices for price and demand forecast, use of futures and options market, expansion of warehouse depository system and to take decisions about specific exports and imports related measures.",,,,,

2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"More than 86% of our farmers are small and marginal. They are not always in a position to directly transact at APMCs and other wholesale markets.  We will develop and upgrade existing 22,000 rural haats into Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs). In these GrAMs, physical infrastructure will be strengthened using MGNREGA and other Government Schemes. These GrAMs, electronically linked to e-NAM and exempted from regulations of APMCs, will provide farmers facility to make direct sale to consumers and bulk purchasers.  ",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,An Agri-Market Infrastructure Fund with a corpus of `2000 crore will be set up for developing and upgrading agricultural marketing infrastructure in the 22000 Grameen Agricultural Markets (GrAMs) and 585 APMCs.,,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Task of connecting all eligible habitations with an all-weather road has been substantially completed, with the target date brought forward to March, 2019 from March 2022. It is now time to strengthen and widen its ambit further to include major link routes which connect habitations to agricultural and rural markets (GrAMs), higher secondary schools and hospitals. Prime Minister Gram Sadak Yojana Phase III will include such linkages.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"For several years, we have been stating that India is primarily an agriculture based country. As India is primarily an agriculture based country, our districts can specialize in some or other agricultural produce and be known for it. But special attention is lacking in this regard. There is a need to develop cluster based model in a scientific manner for identified agriculture produces in our districts in the same manner as we have developed model for industrial sector. ",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Cultivation of horticulture crops in clusters bring advantages of scales of operations and can spur establishment of entire chain from production to marketing, besides giving recognition to the districts for specific crops. The Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare will reorient its ongoing Schemes and promote cluster based development of agri-commodities and regions in partnership with the Ministries of Food Processing, Commerce and other allied Ministries.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Our Government has promoted organic farming in a big way.

Women Self Help Groups (SHGs) will also be encouraged to take up organic agriculture in clusters under National Rural Livelihood Programme.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Our ecology supports cultivation of highly specialized medicinal and aromatic plants.

However, seasonal and regional production of these perishable commodities pose a challenge in connecting farmers and consumers in a manner that satisfies both.

I propose to allocate a sum of `500 crore for this purpose. ",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"India’s agri-exports potential is as high as US $ 100 billion against current exports of US $ 30 billion. To realize this potential, export of agri-commodities will be liberalized. I also propose to set up state-of-the-art testing facilities in all the forty two Mega Food Parks.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,I propose to extend the facility of Kisan Credit Cards to fisheries and animal husbandry farmers to help them meet their working capital needs. Small and marginal farmers will get more benefits.,,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Bamboo is ‘Green Gold’.  We removed bamboo grown outside forest areas from the definition of trees.  Now, I propose to launch a Re-structured National Bamboo Mission with an outlay of `1290 crore to promote bamboo sector in a holistic manner. ",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,Many farmers are installing solar water pumps to irrigate their fields.  Generation of solar electricity is harvesting of Sun by the farmers using their lands. Government of India will take necessary measures and encourage State Governments to put in place a mechanism that their surplus solar power is purchased by the distribution companies or licencees at reasonably remunerative rates. ,,,,,

2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Presently, lessee cultivators are not able to avail crop loans.

2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Madam Speaker, the present top leadership of this country has reached at this level after seeing poverty at close quarters. Our leadership is familiar with the problems being faced by the SC, ST, Backward Classes and economically weaker sections of the society. People belonging to poor and middle class are not case studies for them, on the other hand they themselves are case study.",,,,,

Under this scheme, four crores poor households are being provided with electricity connection free of charge. We are spending `16000 crore under this scheme.

Their life is going to change because of Pradhan Mantri Saubhagya Yojana. ",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Swachh Bharat Mission has benefited the poor. Under this mission, Government has already constructed more than 6 crore toilets.

As Hon’ble Members would recall, we embarked on the path of consistent fiscal reduction and consolidation in 2014.

2018-19,Arun Jaitley,,,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Madam Speaker,",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,I shall now present my tax proposals.,,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"The attempts made by our Government for reducing the cash economy and for increasing the tax net have paid rich dividends. The growth rate of direct taxes in the financial years 2016-17 and 2017-18 has been significant. We ended the last year with a growth of 12.6% in direct taxes and in the current year, the growth in direct taxes up to 15th January, 2018 is 18.7%. The average buoyancy in personal income tax of seven years preceding these two years comes to 1.1. In simple terms tax buoyancy of 1.1 means that if nominal GDP growth rate of the country is 10%, the growth rate of personal income tax is 11%. However, the buoyancy in personal income tax for financial years 2016-17 and 2017-18 (RE) is 1.95 and 2.11 respectively. This indicates that the excess revenue collected in the last two financial years from personal income tax compared to the average buoyancy pre 2016-17 amounts to a total of about `90,000 crores and the same can be attributed to the strong anti-evasion measures taken by the Government. ",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Similarly, there has been huge increase in the number of returns filed by taxpayers. In financial year 2016-17, 85.51 lakhs new taxpayers filed their returns of income as against 66.26 lakhs in the immediately preceding year. By including all filers as well as persons who did not file returns but paid tax by way of advance tax or TDS, we can derive the figure of Effective Taxpayer Base.  This number of effective tax payer base increased from 6.47 crores at the beginning of F.Y.14-15 to 8.27 crores at the end of F.Y.16-17. We are enthused by this success of our measures and we pledge to continue to take all such measures in future by which the black money is contained and the honest taxpayers are rewarded. Demonetization was received well by honest taxpayers as “imandari ka utsav” only for this reason.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Madam Speaker, recognising the need for facilitating compliance, Government had liberalized the presumptive income scheme for small traders and entrepreneurs with annual turnover of less than `2 crores and introduced a similar scheme for professionals with annual turnover of less than `50 lakhs with the hope that there would be significant increase in compliance. Under this scheme, 41% more returns were filed during this year which shows that many more persons are joining the tax net under simplified scheme. However, the turnover shown is still not encouraging. The Department has received 44.72 lakh returns for assessment year",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"2017-18 from individual, HUF and firms with a meagre average turnover of `17.97 lakhs and an average tax payment of `7,000/- only. The tax compliance behaviour of professionals is no better; the department has received 5.68 lakh returns under the presumptive income scheme for assessment year 2017-18 with average gross receipts of `5.73 lakhs only. Average tax paid by them is only `35,000/-.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,Tax incentive for promoting post-harvest activities of agriculture,,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Madam Speaker, at present, hundred per cent deduction is allowed in respect of profit of co-operative societies which provide assistance to its members engaged in primary agricultural activities. Over the last few years, a number of Farmer Producer Companies have been set up along the lines of co-operative societies which also provide similar assistance to their members. In order to encourage professionalism in post-harvest value addition in agriculture, I propose to allow hundred per cent deduction to these companies registered as Farmer Producer Companies and having annual turnover up to `100 crores in respect of their profit derived from such activities for a period of five years from financial year 2018-19. This measure will encourage “Operation Greens” mission announced by me earlier and it will give a boost to Sampada Yojana.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,Employment generation,,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Currently, a deduction of 30% is allowed in addition to normal deduction of 100 % in respect of emoluments paid to eligible new employees who have been employed for a minimum period of 240 days during the year under section 80-JJAA of the Income-tax Act. However, the minimum period of employment is relaxed to 150 days in the case of apparel industry. In order to encourage creation of new employment,",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"I propose to extend this relaxation to footwear and leather industry. Further, I also propose to rationalise this deduction of 30% by allowing the benefit for a new employee who is employed for less than the minimum period during the first year but continues to remain employed for the minimum period in subsequent year. ",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,Incentive for real estate,,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Currently, while taxing income from capital gains, business profits and other sources in respect of transactions in immovable property, the consideration or circle rate value, whichever is higher, is adopted and the difference is counted as income both in the hands of the purchaser and seller. Sometimes, this variation can occur in respect of different properties in the same area because of a variety of factors including shape of the plot and location. In order to minimize hardship in real estate transaction,",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,I propose to provide that no adjustment shall be made in a case where the circle rate value does not exceed 5% of the consideration. ,,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Incentivising micro, small and medium entrepreneurs",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"In the Union Budget, 2017, I had announced the reduction of corporate tax rate to 25% for companies whose turnover was less than `50 crore in financial year 2015-16. This benefitted 96% of the total companies filing tax returns. Towards fulfilment of my promise to reduce corporate tax rate in a phased manner, I now propose to extend the benefit of this reduced rate of 25% also to companies who have reported turnover up to `250 crore in the financial year 2016-17. This will benefit the entire class of micro, small and medium enterprises which accounts for almost 99% of companies filing their tax returns. The estimate of revenue forgone due to this measure is `7,000 crores during the financial year 2018-19. After this, out of about 7 lakh companies filing returns, about 7,000 companies which file returns of income and whose turnover is above `250 crores will remain in 30% slab. The lower corporate income tax rate for 99% of the companies will leave them with higher investible surplus which in turn will create more jobs.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,Relief to salaried taxpayers,,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"The Government had made many positive changes in the personal income-tax rate applicable to individuals in the last three years. Therefore,",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"I do not propose to make any further change in the structure of the income tax rates for individuals. There is a general perception in the society that individual business persons have better income as compared to salaried class. However, income tax data analysis suggests that major portion of personal income-tax collection comes from the salaried class. For assessment year 2016-17, 1.89 crore salaried individuals have filed their returns and have paid total tax of `1.44 lakh crores which works out to average tax payment of `76,306/- per individual salaried taxpayer. As against this, 1.88 crores individual business taxpayers including professionals, who filed their returns for the same assessment year paid total tax of `48,000 crores which works out to an average tax payment of `25,753/- per individual business taxpayer. In order to provide relief to salaried taxpayers, I propose to allow a standard deduction of `40,000/- in lieu of the present exemption in respect of transport allowance and reimbursement of miscellaneous medical expenses. However, the transport allowance at enhanced rate shall continue to be available to differently- abled persons. Also other medical reimbursement benefits in case of hospitalization etc., for all employees shall continue. Apart from reducing paper work and compliance, this will help middle class employees even more in terms of reduction in their tax liability. This decision to allow standard deduction shall significantly benefit the pensioners also, who normally do not enjoy any allowance on account of transport and medical expenses. The revenue cost of this decision is approximately `8,000 crores. The total number of salaried employees and pensioners who will benefit from this decision is around 2.5 crores.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,Relief to senior citizen,,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"A life with dignity is a right of every individual in general, more so for the senior citizens. To care of those who cared for us is one of the highest honours. To further the objective of providing a dignified life, I propose to announce the following incentives for senior citizens:",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Exemption of interest income on deposits with banks and post offices to be increased from `10,000/- to `50,000/- and TDS shall not be required to be deducted on such income, under section 194A. This benefit shall be available also for interest from all fixed deposits schemes and recurring deposit schemes.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Raising the limit of deduction for health insurance premium and/ or medical expenditure from `30,000/- to `50,000/-, under section 80D. All senior citizens will now be able to claim benefit of deduction up to `50,000/- per annum in respect of any health insurance premium and/or any general medical expenditure incurred. ",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Raising the limit of deduction for medical expenditure in respect of certain critical illness from, `60,000/- in case of senior citizens and from `80,000/- in case of very senior citizens, to `1 lakh in respect of all senior citizens, under section 80DDB.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"These concessions will give extra tax benefit of `4,000 crores to senior citizens. In addition to tax concessions, I propose to extend the Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana up to March, 2020 under which an assured return of 8% is given by Life Insurance Corporation of India. The existing limit on investment of `7.5 lakh per senior citizen under this scheme is also being enhanced to `15 lakh.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,Tax incentive for International Financial Services Centre (IFSC),,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"The Government had endeavoured to develop a world class international financial services centre in India. In recent years, various measures including tax incentives have been provided in order to fulfil this objective. To further this objective, I propose to provide two more concessions for IFSC. In order to promote trade in stock exchanges located in IFSC, I propose to exempt transfer of derivatives and certain securities by non-residents from capital gains tax. Further, non-corporate taxpayers operating in IFSC shall be charged Alternate Minimum Tax (AMT) at concessional rate of 9% at par with Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) applicable for corporates.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,Further Measures to control cash economy: ,,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Currently, the income of trusts and institutions is exempt if they utilise their income towards their objects in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Income-tax Act. However, there is no restriction on these entities for incurring expenditure in cash. In order to have audit trail of the expenses incurred by these entities, it is proposed that payments exceeding `10,000/- in cash made by such entities shall be disallowed and the same shall be subject to tax. Further, in order to improve TDS compliance by these entities, I propose to provide that in case of non-deduction of tax, 30% of the amount shall be disallowed and the same shall be taxed.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,Rationalisation of Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG),,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Madam Speaker, currently, long term capital gains arising from transfer of listed equity shares, units of equity oriented fund and unit of a business trust are exempt from tax. With the reforms introduced by the Government and incentives given so far, the equity market has become buoyant. The total amount of exempted capital gains from listed shares and units is around `3,67,000 crores as per returns filed for A.Y.17-18. Major part of this gain has accrued to corporates and LLPs. This has also created a bias against manufacturing, leading to more business surpluses being invested in financial assets. The return on investment in equity is already quite attractive even without tax exemption. There is therefore a strong case for bringing long term capital gains from listed equities in the tax net. However, recognising the fact that vibrant equity market is essential for economic growth, I propose only a modest change in the present regime.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"I propose to tax such long term capital gains exceeding `1 lakh at the rate of 10% without allowing the benefit of any indexation. However, all gains up to 31st January, 2018 will be grandfathered. For example, if an equity share is purchased six months before 31st January, 2018 at `100/- and the highest price quoted on 31st January, 2018 in respect of this share is `120/-, there will be no tax on the gain of `20/- if this share is sold after one year from the date of purchase. However, any gain in excess of `20 earned after 31st January, 2018 will be taxed at 10% if this share is sold after 31st July, 2018.  The gains from equity share held up to one year will remain short term capital gain and will continue to be taxed at the rate of 15%. Further,",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"I also propose to introduce a tax on distributed income by equity oriented mutual fund at the rate of 10%. This will provide level playing field across growth oriented funds and dividend distributing funds. In view of grandfathering, this change in capital gain tax will bring marginal revenue gain of about `20,000 crores in the first year. The revenues in subsequent years may be more.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,Health and Education Cess,,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Madam Speaker, at present there is a three per cent cess on personal income tax and corporation tax consisting of two per cent cess for primary education and one per cent cess for secondary and higher education. In order to take care of the needs of education and health of BPL and rural families, I have announced programs in Part A of my speech. To fund this, I propose to increase the cess by one per cent. The existing three per cent education cess will be replaced by a four per cent “Health and Education Cess” to be levied on the tax payable. This will enable us to collect an estimated additional amount of `11,000 crores.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,E-assessment.,,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"We had introduced e-assessment in 2016 on a pilot basis and in 2017, extended it to 102 cities with the objective of reducing the interface between the department and the taxpayers. With the experience gained so far, we are now ready to roll out the E-assessment across the country, which will transform the age-old assessment procedure of the income tax department and the manner in which they interact with taxpayers and other stakeholders. Accordingly, I propose to amend the Income-tax Act to notify a new scheme for assessment where the assessment will be done in electronic mode which will almost eliminate person to person contact leading to greater efficiency and transparency.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,My other tax proposals on direct tax are listed in Annexure 5 of my speech.,,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,Indirect Tax.,,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"On the Indirect Taxes side, this is the first budget after the roll out of the Goods and Service Tax. Excise duties to a large extent and service tax have been subsumed in GST, along with corresponding duties on imports. Hence, my budget proposals are mainly on the customs side.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"In this budget, I am making a calibrated departure from the underlying policy in the last two decades, wherein the trend largely was to reduce the customs duty. There is substantial potential for domestic value addition in certain sectors, like food processing, electronics, auto components, footwear and furniture. To further incentivise the domestic value addition and Make in India in some such sectors, I propose to increase customs duty on certain items. I propose to increase customs duty on mobile phones from 15% to 20%, on some of their parts and accessories to 15% and on certain parts of TVs to 15%. This measure will promote creation of more jobs in the country. Details of changes made in rates of customs duty as well as certain changes made in the excise duty structure are given in Annexure 6 to my speech. ",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"To help the cashew processing industry, I propose to reduce customs duty on raw cashew from 5% to 2.5%.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"I propose to abolish the Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess on imported goods, and in its place impose a Social Welfare Surcharge, at the rate of 10% of the aggregate duties of Customs, on imported goods, to provide for social welfare schemes of the Government.  Goods which were hitherto exempt from Education Cesses on imported goods will, however, be exempt from this Surcharge. In addition, certain specified goods, mentioned in the Annexure 6 to my speech will attract the proposed Surcharge at the rate of 3% of the aggregate duties of customs only.  ",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"I also propose to make certain changes to the Customs Act, 1962, to further improve ease of doing business in cross border trade, and to align certain provisions with the commitments under the Trade Facilitation Agreement. To smoothen dispute resolution processes and to reduce litigation, certain amendments are being made, to provide for pre-notice consultation, definite timelines for adjudication and deemed closure of cases if those timelines are not adhered to. ",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"With the roll out of GST, I propose to change the name of Central Board of Excise and Customs [CBEC] to Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC). The necessary changes in law for this are proposed in the Finance Bill.",,,,,
2018-19,Arun Jaitley,"Madam, while making the proposals in this year’s Budget, we have been guided by our mission to especially strengthen agriculture, rural development, health, education, employment, MSME and infrastructure sectors of Indian economy.  I am sure the New India which we aspire to create now will emerge. Swami Vivekanand had also envisioned decades ago in his Memoirs of European Travel, ‘‘You merge yourselves in the void and disappear, and let new India arise in your place. Let her arise – out of the peasants’ cottage, grasping the plough; out of the huts of the fisherman. Let her spring from the grocer’s shop, from beside the oven of the fritter-seller.  Let her emanate from the factory, from marts, and from markets.  Let her emerge from groves and forests, from hills and mountains’’. ",,,,,

2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"The recent election which brought us to this august House today, was charged with brimming hope and desire for a bright and stable New India. Like never before, India celebrated its democracy by coming out to vote in large numbers, like never before. Voter turnout was the highest at 67.9%. Every section – young, old, first time voters, voters since the first General Election, women – all turned up to stamp their approval of a performing Government. Through their unambiguous and firm mandate they have reaffirmed “putting the nation first”. The people of India have validated the two goals for our country’s future: that of national society and economic growth.",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"The first term of Hon'ble PM Narendra Modi-led-NDA-Government stood out as a performing Government, a Government whose signature was in the last mile delivery. Between 2014-19, we provided a rejuvenated Centre-State dynamic, cooperative federalism, GST Council, and a strident commitment to fiscal discipline. We had set the ball rolling for a New India, planned and assisted by the NITI Aayog, a broad based think tank. We have showed by our deeds that the principle “Reform, Perform, Transform” can succeed. ",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"On many programmes and initiatives we had worked on unprecedented scale. Average amount spent on food security per year approximately doubled during 2014-19 compared to the preceding five years. Number of patents issued more than trebled in 2017-18 as against the number of patents issued in 2014. Our last mile delivery stood out and the unknown citizen in every nook and corner of our country felt the difference.

2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"The Indian economy will grow to become a 3 trillion dollar economyin the current year. It is now the sixth largest in the world. Five years ago, it was at the 11th position. In Purchasing Power Parity terms, we are in fact, the 3rd largest economy already, only next to China and the USA.",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"To attain this and more we need to continue undertaking many structural reforms. In the last five years, we saw many big reforms in particular, in indirect taxation, bankruptcy and real estate. While these reforms were happening here in the Parliament, the common man’s life was being changed through MUDRA loans to help him do his business, and through several programmes it was being ensured that his/her kitchen had become smokeless, his/her house got electricity connection and women’s dignity was respected with the provision of toilets in homes. The common man was served even as major transformational reforms were being rolled out.  And for this to continue we need to invest heavily in infrastructure, in digital economy and on job creation in small and medium firms.",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"Respected Speaker Sir, it took over 55 years for the Indian economy to reach 1 trillion dollar but when the country and her people’s hearts are filled with aasha, vishwas and aakansha that is, when hearts are filled with hope, trust and aspirations, we, in 5 years, added 1 trillion dollar. Today we are nearing a 3 trillion dollar level. So when we aspire to reach a 5 trillion dollar level, many wonder if it is possible. If we can appreciate our citizens’ ""purusharth” or their “goals of human pursuit” filled with their inherent desire to progress led by the dedicated leadership present in this House, the target is eminently achievable. ",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"All of India’s private sector industries – small, medium or large – have played a substantial role in growing our economy. I recall the words of an eminent industry leader, who said that his company’s growth has always aligned itself with India’s growth, before and post-independence. So if before-independence, India Inc. understood ‘Swadeshi’, today they understand ‘Make in India’. We do not look down upon legitimate profit-earning. Gone are the days of policy paralysis and license-quota-control regimes. India Inc. are India’s job-creators. They are the nation’s wealth-creators. Together, with mutual trust, we can gain, catalyze fast and attain sustained national growth. I wish to propose a number of initiatives as part of a framework for kick-starting the virtuous cycle of domestic and foreign investments.",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"Connectivity is the lifeblood of an economy. The Government has given a massive push to all forms of physical connectivity through Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, industrial corridors, dedicated freight corridors, Bhartamala and Sagarmala projects, Jal Marg Vikas and UDAN Schemes. While the industrial corridors would improve infrastructure availability for greater industrial investment in the catchment regions, the dedicated freight corridors would mitigate the congestion of our railway network benefitting the common man. The ambitious programme of Bharatmala would help develop national road corridors and highways, while Sagarmala would enhance port connectivity, modernization and port-linked industrialization. If Sagarmala is aimed at improving the infrastructure for external trade, equally it is the poor man’s transport too. Waterways are proven as a cheap mode of transport. The Jal Marg Vikas project for capacity augmentation of navigation on National Waterways is aimed at smoothening internal trade carried through inland water transport. These initiatives will improve logistics tremendously, reducing the cost of transportation and increasing the competitiveness of domestically produced goods.",,,,,

This Government envisions using the rivers for cargo transportation, which will also help to decongest roads and railways. As part of the Jal Marg Vikas Project for enhancing the navigational capacity of Ganga, a multi modal terminal at Varanasi has become functional in November 2018 and two more such terminals at Sahibganj and Haldia and a navigational lock at Farakka would be completed in 2019-20.

Further, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the regulator for NBFCs.  However, RBI has limited regulatory authority over NBFCs.  Appropriate proposals for strengthening the regulatory authority of RBI over NBFCs are being placed in the Finance Bill. ",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"NBFCs which do public placement of debt have to maintain a Debenture Redemption Reserve (DRR) and in addition, a special reserve as required by RBI, has also to be maintained.  To allow NBFCs to raise funds in public issues, the requirement of creating a DRR, which is currently applicable for only public issues as private placements are exempt, will be done away with.",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"To bring more participants, especially NBFCs, not registered as NBFCs-Factor, on the TReDS platform, amendment in the Factoring Regulation Act, 2011 is necessary and steps will be taken to allow all NBFCs to directly participate on the TReDS platform. ",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"Efficient and conducive regulation of the housing sector is extremely important in our context.  The National Housing Bank (NHB), besides being the refinancer and lender, is also regulator of the housing finance sector.  This gives a somewhat conflicting and difficult mandate to NHB.  I am proposing to return the regulation authority over the housing finance sector from NHB to RBI.  Necessary proposals have been placed in the Finance Bill.  ",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"Government has announced its intention to invest ` 100 lakh crore in infrastructure over the next five years.

2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"Government has been following the policy of disinvestment in non-financial public sector undertakings maintaining Government stake not to go below 51%. Government is considering, in case where the Undertaking is still to be retained in Government control, to go below 51% to an appropriate level on case to case basis. Government has also decided to modify present policy of  retaining 51% Government stake to retaining 51% stake inclusive of the stake of Government controlled institutions.",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"In order to improve the capital flows into the Indian economy, it is important to align domestic corporate systems and practices with global ones. It is also appreciated that global finance movement in equity uses certain parameters to evaluate the stocks in which they choose to invest. Government intends to further encourage retail participation in CPSEs which, of late has shown very encouraging upward trend. In order to provide additional investment space, the Government would realign its holding in CPSEs, including Banks to permit greater availability of its shares and to improve depth of its market. ",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"Strategic disinvestment of select CPSEs would continue to remain a priority of this Government. In view of current macro-economic parameters, Government would not only reinitiate the process of strategic disinvestment of Air India, but would offer more CPSEs for strategic participation by the private sector.",,,,,

2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"ETFs have proved to be an important investment opportunity for retail investors and has turned out to be a good instrument for Government of India’s divestment programme. To expand this further, Government will offer an investment option in ETFs on the lines of Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS). This would also encourage long term investment in CPSEs.",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"For bringing better public ownership of the PSUs and also bring greater commercial and market orientation of the listed PSUs, the Government will take all necessary steps to meet public shareholding norms of 25% for all listed PSUs and raise the foreign shareholding limits to maximum permissible sector limits for all PSU companies which are part of Emerging Market Index.",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,India’s sovereign external debt to GDP is among the lowest globally at less than 5%.

2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"107.Mr. Speaker, Sir, due to slew of efforts  taken by our Government, the direct tax revenue  has significantly increased  over the past couple of years. It has increased by over 78% from ` 6.38 lakh crore  in  Financial Year 2013-14  to  around ` 11.37 lakh crore in Financial Year 2018-19. It is now growing at double digit rate every year.  ",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"108.Let me recall and reiterate this Government’s effort over the past five years to alleviate the tax burden on small and medium income-earners.

The details of our efforts and achievements on this front during the past few years are given in the Annexure.",,,,,

Currently, the lower rate of 25 % is only applicable to companies having annual turnover up to ` 250 Crore. I propose to widen this to include all companies having  annual turnover up to ` 400 crore.  This will  cover 99.3% of the companies. Now only 0.7% of companies will remain outside this rate.",,,,,

2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"112. Considering our large consumer base, we  aim to leapfrog and envision  India as a global hub of  manufacturing of Electric Vehicles.  Inclusion of Solar storage batteries and charging infrastructure in the above scheme will boost our efforts. Government has already moved GST council to lower the GST rate on electric vehicles from 12% to 5%. Also to make electric vehicle affordable to consumers, our government will provide additional income tax deduction of `1.5 lakh on the interest paid on loans taken to purchase electric vehicles. This  amounts to a benefit of around `2.5 lakh over the  loan period to the taxpayers who  take loans to purchase electric vehicle.   ",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,Start-ups,,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"113.Start-ups in India are taking firm roots and their continued growth needs to be encouraged.  To resolve the so-called ‘angel tax’ issue, the start-ups and their investors who file requisite declarations and provide information in their returns will not be subjected to any kind of scrutiny in respect of   valuations of share premiums. The issue of establishing identity of the investor and source of his funds will be resolved   by putting in place a mechanism of e-verification.   With this, funds raised by start-ups will not require any kind of scrutiny from the Income Tax Department. ",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"114.In addition, special administrative arrangements shall be made by Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) for pending assessments of start-ups and redressal of their grievances. It will be ensured that no inquiry or verification in such cases can be carried out by the Assessing Officer without obtaining approval of his supervisory officer.  ",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"115.At present, start-ups are not required to justify fair market value of their shares issued to certain investors including Category-I Alternative Investment Funds (AIF). I propose to extend this benefit to Category-II Alternative Investment Funds also. Therefore, valuation of shares issued to these funds shall be beyond the scope of income tax scrutiny.",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,116.I also propose to relax some of the conditions for carry forward and set off of losses in the case of start-ups. I also propose to extend the period of exemption of capital gains arising from sale of residential house for investment in start-ups up to 31.3.2021 and relax certain conditions of this exemption.   ,,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,Affordable housing,,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"117. For realisation of the goal of ‘Housing for All’ and affordable housing, a tax holiday has already been provided on the profits earned by developers of affordable housing. Also, interest paid on housing loans is allowed as a deduction to the extent of ` 2 lakh in respect of self-occupied property. In order to provide a further impetus, I propose to allow an additional deduction of up to ` 1,50,000/- for interest paid on loans borrowed up to 31st March, 2020 for purchase of an affordable house valued up to ` 45 lakh. Therefore, a person purchasing an affordable house will now get an enhanced interest deduction up to ` 3.5 lakh. This will translate into a benefit of around ` 7 lakh to the middle class home-buyers overtheir loan period of 15 years.",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,NBFCs,,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"118.Non-banking financial companies play an increasingly important role in India’s financial system. With the enhanced levels of regulation they are subjected to by the Reserve Bank of India, there is a need to provide greater parity in their tax treatment vis-à-vis scheduled banks. Currently, interest on certain bad or doubtful debts made by scheduled banks and other financial institutions is allowed to be offered to tax in the year in which this interest is actually received. I propose to extend this facility to deposit taking as well as systemically important non-deposit taking NBFCs also.",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,IFSC,,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"119.To promote the International Financial Services Centre(IFSC) in GIFT City, series of measures have already been taken in the past by this Government.  With a view to further incentivising the IFSC, I propose to further provide several direct tax incentives to an IFSC including 100 % profit-linked deduction under section 80-LA in any ten-year block within a fifteen-year period, exemption from dividend distribution tax  from  current and accumulated income to companies and mutual funds, exemptions on capital gain to Category-III AIF and interest payment on loan taken from non-residents.

2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,Securities Transaction Tax (STT),,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,120. I propose to give relief in levy of Securities Transaction Tax (STT) by restricting it only to the difference between settlement and strike price in case of exercise of options.,,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,Simplification and Ease of living,,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,121. India’s Ease of Doing Business ranking under the category of ‘paying taxes’ showed a significant jump from 172 in 2017  to 121 in the 2019. I now propose to implement series of measures that will leverage technology to make compliance easier for the taxpayers.,,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,Interchangeability of PAN and Aadhaar,,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"122.  Mr Speaker, Sir, more than 120 Crore Indians now have Aadhaar. Therefore, for ease and convenience of tax payers, I propose to make PAN and Aadhaar interchangeable and allow those who do not have PAN to file  Income Tax  returns by simply quoting their Aadhaar number and  also use it wherever they are required to quote PAN. ",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,Pre-filling of Income-tax Returns,,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"123. Pre-filled tax returns will be made available to taxpayers which will contain details of salary income, capital gains from securities, bank interests, and dividends etc. and tax deductions. Information regarding these incomes will be collected from the concerned sources such as Banks, Stock exchanges, mutual funds, EPFO, State Registration Departments etc. This will not only significantly reduce the time taken to file a tax return, but will also ensure accuracy of reporting of income and taxes.",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,Faceless e-assessment,,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"124.The existing system of scrutiny assessments in the Income-tax Department involves a high level of personal interaction between the taxpayer and the Department, which leads to certain undesirable practices on the part of tax officials.  To eliminate such instances, and to give shape to the vision of the Hon’ble Prime Minister, a scheme of faceless assessment in electronic mode  involving no human interface is being launched this year in a phased manner. To start with, such e-assessments shall be carried out in cases requiring verification of certain specified transactions or discrepancies.",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"125.  Cases selected for scrutiny shall be allocated to assessment units in a random manner and notices shall be issued electronically by a Central Cell, without disclosing the name, designation or location of the Assessing Officer. The Central Cell shall be the single point of contact between the taxpayer and the Department.   This new scheme of assessment will represent a paradigm shift in the functioning of the Income Tax Department.",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,Digital Payments,,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"126.Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Government has taken a number of initiatives in the recent past for the promotion of digital payments and less cash economy. To promote digital payments further, I propose to take a slew of measures. To discourage the practice of making business payments in cash, I propose to levy TDS of 2% on cash withdrawal exceeding ` 1 crore in a year from a bank account.  Further, there are low-cost digital modes of payment such as BHIM UPI, UPI-QR Code, Aadhaar Pay, certain Debit cards, NEFT, RTGS etc. which can be used to promote less cash economy.  I, therefore, propose that the business establishments with annual turnover more than ` 50 crore shall offer such low cost digital modes of payment to their customers and no charges or Merchant Discount Rate shall be imposed on customers as well as merchants. RBI and Banks will absorb these costs from the savings that will accrue to them on account of handling less cash as people move to these digital modes of payment.  Necessary amendments are being made in the Income Tax Act and the Payments and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 to give effect to these provisions.",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,Revenue Mobilization,,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"127.  Mr Speaker Sir, as I have stated earlier,  we have taken several measures in the past to alleviate the tax burden on small and medium income-earners as those  having annual income up to  ` 5 lakh are not required to pay any income-tax. We are thankful to the taxpayers who play a major role in  nation building by paying  their taxes. However, in view of rising income levels,  those in the highest income brackets, need to contribute more to the Nation’s development. I, therefore, propose to enhance surcharge on  individuals  having taxable income from  ` 2 crore to ` 5 crore and  ` 5 crore and above  so that effective tax rates for these two categories will increase by around 3 % and 7 % respectively.",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,Other measures,,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,128.I also propose to simplify the tax law to reduce genuine hardships being caused to taxpayers which include enhancing threshold of tax for launching prosecution for non-filing of returns and exempting appropriate class of persons from the anti-abuse provisions of section 50CA and section 56 of the Income Tax Act.  ,,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,Indirect Taxes,,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"129. Now coming to Indirect Tax, we are aware that the  landscape has changed significantly with implementation of GST. In every sense, this has been a monumental reform. Centre and States coming together and agreeing to pool in their sovereign power of taxation for common good of the country was unprecedented. 17 taxes and 13 cesses became one tax. Multitude of rates instantly became four. Almost all commodities saw rate reduction. Tens of returns were replaced by one.   Taxpayer’s interface with tax departments got reduced. Border checks got eliminated. Goods started moving freely across states, which saved time and energy. A truck started doing two trips in the same time in which it was doing one. Thus, dream of one nation, one tax, one market was realised. The GST Council deserves all the credit for this.    ",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"130.In the initial phase GST witnessed certain teething problems. This was natural considering the scale of the reform. However, the Council, Centre and States proactively worked to resolve these issues.   GST rates have also been reduced significantly, where relief of about `92,000 crore per year has been given.  We should not lose sight of this fact while judging the performance of GST. The details are given in the annexure. ",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,131. We are further simplifying the GST processes. A simplified single monthly return is being rolled out. Taxpayer having annual turnover of less than   `5 crore shall file quarterly return. Free accounting software for return preparation has been made available to small businesses.  A fully automated GST refund module shall be implemented.  Multiple tax ledgers for a taxpayer shall be replaced by one.,,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"132.It is also proposed to move to an electronic invoice system wherein invoice details will be captured in a central system at the time of issuance. This will eventually be used to prefill the taxpayer’s returns. There will be no need for a separate e-way bill. Its roll out would begin from January, 2020.    Electronic invoice system will significantly reduce the compliance burden.  ",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"133. On the Customs side my proposals are driven with the objectives of securing our borders, achieving higher domestic value addition through make in India, reducing import dependence, protection to MSME sector, promoting clean energy, curbing non-essential imports, and correcting inversions. ",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"134. Defence has an immediate requirement of modernisation and upgradation. This is a national priority. For this purpose, import of defence equipment that are not being manufactured in India are being exempted from the basic customs duty.   ",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"135.Make in India is a cherished goal.  In order to provide  domestic industry a level playing field, basic customs duty is being increased on items such as cashew kernels, PVC, Vinyl flooring, tiles, metal fittings, mountings for furniture, auto parts, certain kinds of synthetic rubbers, marble slabs, optical fibre cable, CCTV camera, IP camera, digital and network video recorders etc. Also, exemptions from custom duty on certain electronic items which are now being manufactured in India are being withdrawn. Further, end use based exemptions on palm stearin, fatty oils, and exemptions to various kinds of papers are also being withdrawn. To encourage domestic publishing and printing industry, 5 % custom duty is being imposed on imported books. ",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"136. To further promote domestic manufacturing, customs duty reductions are being proposed on certain raw materials and capital goods. These include certain inputs of CRGO sheets, amorphous alloy ribbon, ethylene di-chloride, propylene oxide, cobalt matte, naphtha, wool fibres, inputs for manufacture of artificial kidney and disposable sterilised dialyser, and fuels for nuclear power plants. To further incentivise e-mobility, customs duty is being exempted on certain parts of electric vehicles. Customs duty is also being exempted on capital goods required for manufacture of specified electronic goods.",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,137. Export duty is being rationalised on raw and semi-finished leather to provide relief to this sector.,,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,138.  Crude prices have softened from their highs. This gives me a room to review excise duty and cess on petrol and diesel. I propose to increase Special Additional Excise duty and Road and Infrastructure Cess each by one rupee a litre on petrol and diesel. It is also proposed to increase custom duty on gold and other precious metals from 10% to 12.5%. ,,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"139. Tobacco products and crude attract National Calamity and Contingent duty. In certain cases this levy has been contested on the ground that there is no basic excise duty on these items. To address this issue, a nominal basic excise duty is being imposed.",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"140. I am also proposing few amendments to the Customs Act. Recent trends reveal that certain bogus entities are resorting to unfair practices to avail undue concessions and export incentives.   While we have intensified our efforts against such nefarious activities, provisions are being incorporated in the Act for enhanced penalty and prosecution for such offences. Further, misuse of duty free scrips and drawback facility involving more than fifty lakh rupees will be a cognizable and non-bailable offence.",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"141.  GST has just completed two years. An area that concerns me is that we have huge pending litigations from pre-GST regime. More than ` 3.75 lakh crore is blocked in litigations in service tax and excise. There is a need to unload this baggage and allow business to move on. I, therefore, propose, a Legacy Dispute Resolution Scheme that will allow quick closure of these litigations. I would urge the trade and business to avail this opportunity and be free from legacy litigations. ",,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,142. The details of my tax proposals  are given in the Annexure.,,,,,
2019-20,Nirmala Sitharaman,"143.Mr. Speaker Sir, with these words I commend the Budget to this august House.",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"Hon’ble Speaker, I rise to present the Budget for the year 2020-2021. ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,Introduction,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"In May 2019, Prime Minister Modi received a massive mandate to form the government again. With renewed vigour, under his leadership, we commit ourselves to serve the people of India, with all humility and dedication. ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"2. People of India have unequivocally given their jan-aadesh for not just political stability and also reposed faith in our economic policies. This is the Budget to boost their incomes and enhance their purchasing power.  Only through higher growth we can achieve that and have our youth gainfully and meaningfully employed. Let our businesses be innovative, healthy and solvent with use of technology.",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"3.For today’s youth born at the turn of the century, for every member of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes who seeks a better life, for every woman wishing to stand up and get counted, for every individual from the minority sections of our society – this Budget aims to have your aspirations and hopes addressed. ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"4. We wish to open up vistas for a vibrant and dynamic economy with a gentle breeze of new technology. This vibrant India shall be a caring society which shall attend to its weak, the old and the vulnerable among its citizens. ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"5.During 2014-19, our government brought in a paradigm shift in governance. This shift was characterised by a twin focus: fundamental structural reform and inclusive growth. ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,6.Fundamentals of the economy are strong and that has ensured macroeconomic stability. Inflation has been well contained.  Banks saw a thorough cleaning up of accumulated loans of the past decade and then they were recapitalized.  Companies were provided an exit through the IBC. Several steps on the formalisation of the economy were taken up. ,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"7. Of the structural reforms, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has been the most historic in our country.  Its chief architect is not with us today. I pay homage to the visionary leader late Shri Arun Jaitley ji. At the time of roll out of GST, he had said and I quote: ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"“It will be an India where the Centre and States will work harmoniously towards the common goal of shared prosperity.  The unanimity of the Constitutional amendment and the consensus of the GST Council highlights that India can rise above narrow politics for the nation’s interest. With the GST, neither the state nor the Centre loses its sovereignty. In contrast, they will pool their sovereignty on decisions on indirect taxes.”",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"8.True to this vision for the historic structural reform, the Goods and Services Tax has been gradually maturing into a tax that has integrated the country economically. It has consolidated numerous taxes and cesses to one tax and facilitated formalization of economy. It has resulted in the efficiency gains in logistic and transport sectors.  The turnaround time for trucks has witnessed a substantial reduction to the tune of 20% due to abolition of check posts in GST.  The dreaded Inspector-Raj has also vanished.  ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"9.It has also led to significant benefits to MSME by way of enhanced threshold and composition limits.  The effective tax incidence on almost every commodity came down substantially.  Through several rate reductions, an annual benefit of ` one lakh crore has been extended to consumers.  It amounts to 10% reduction in overall tax incidence. An average household now saves about 4% on its monthly spends on account of reduced GST rates. ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"10.During this phase of maturing, GST did face certain challenges. This was natural as transition was daunting. GST Council has been proactive in resolving issues during transition.  In the last two years we have added more than 60 lakh new taxpayers, a total of about 40 crore returns were filed, 800 crore invoices were uploaded, and 105 crore e-way bills were generated. There has been extensive engagement with stakeholders. A simplified new return system is being introduced from April 1, 2020. ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"11. A former Prime Minister had once voiced a concern that the fruits of the welfare schemes were not reaching the intended citizens – the common and deserving citizen was only receiving 15 paisa of every rupee sent for him. Guided by “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas”, our government and our Prime Minister added manifold speed and scaled up the implementation of schemes and programmes that directly benefitted the poor and the disadvantaged.  I wish to list out only a few as examples: (a) welfare schemes with Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) embedded in them; (b) sanitation and water as provision of basic needs and as a measure of preventive healthcare; (c) healthcare, through Ayushman Bharat; (d) clean energy through Ujjwala and solar power; (e) financial inclusion, credit support, insurance protection to vulnerable sections and pension scheme; (f) digital penetration with broadband and UPI; (g) Affordable Housing for all through PMAY.",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"The milestones achieved are unprecedented, globally recognised and benchmarked against international indices.  ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"12.This strategy, changed the established order of a few individuals cornering most of the benefits and was appreciated by the people. This had immensely positive outcomes. We have moved on from a growth rate of just over 4% in 1950s to 6% in 1980s and1990s. However, during 2014-19 we clocked growth of 7.4% on average with inflation, averaging around 4.5%. It is worthwhile to note that inflation was close to 9% in the last two decades of the last millennium and ranged 10.5% during 2009-14. Between 2006-16, India was able to raise 271 million people out of poverty, which we all should be proud of.   ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"13. We are now the fifth largest economy of the world.

2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"113.Mr Speaker, Sir, our Government has spearheaded radical fiscal measures to ensure that India’s economy continues to tread the path of high growth. These are times when countries are competing with each other like never before to become the most attractive destination for doing business. Therefore, to make sure that India stays globally competitive and a favoured destination for  investment, we took a bold  historic decision of reducing the corporate tax rate for new companies in the manufacturing sector to an unprecedented level of 15%. Similarly, for the existing companies, the rate has also been brought down to just 22%. As a result, our corporate tax rates are now amongst the lowest in the world. This will enable companies to expand their businesses and make fresh investments in the coming future. Though we will have loss of substantial revenue due to these measures in the short-run, I am certain that our economy will reap huge returns on this score in due course. ",,,,,

2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,115.Personal Income Tax  and simplification of taxation ,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"·      In the interim Budget of 2019, our government exempted  individuals having income up to ` 5 Lakh from paying any income tax. Presently,  an individual pays 20% on income between ` 5 Lakh to ` 10 Lakh and 30% on income above ` 10 Lakh.   Further, currently the Income Tax Act is riddled with various exemptions and deductions which make compliance by the taxpayer and administration of the Income Tax Act by the tax authorities a burdensome process. It is almost impossible for a taxpayer to comply with the Income-tax law without taking help from professionals.  ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"·      In order to provide significant relief to the individual taxpayers and to simplify the Income-tax law, I propose to  bring a  new and simplified personal income tax regime wherein income tax rates will be significantly reduced for the individual taxpayers who  forgo  certain deductions and exemptions. ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"·      Under the new regime, an individual shall be required to pay tax at the  reduced rate  of  10% for income between ` 5 Lakh to ` 7. 5 Lakh  against the current rate of 20%.  ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,·      For income between ` 7.5 Lakh to ` 10 Lakh he will pay at the reduced  rate of  15%  against  the current rate of 20 %.  ,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,·      Similarly for the income between ` 10 Lakh to ` 12.5 Lakh  the taxpayer  will pay at the reduced rate of 20% against the current rate of 30 %.  ,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,·      The income  between ` 12.5 Lakh to ` 15 Lakh  will be taxed  at the reduced rate of 25% against the existing rate of 30 %.  Incomes above ` 15 lakh will be  continued to be taxed at the rate of 30 %. ,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,·      Those earning up to ` 5 lakhs shall not pay any tax either in the old regime or in  the new regime. ,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,·      The proposed tax structure will provide significant relief to  taxpayers and more so to those in the middle class. ,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"·      In the new tax regime, substantial tax benefit will accrue  to a taxpayer depending upon exemptions and deductions claimed by him.  For example, a person  earning ` 15 lakh  in a year and  not availing any deductions etc. will  pay only  `, 1,95,000 as compared to `, 2,73,000 in the old regime. Thus his tax burden shall be reduced by 78,000 in the new regime.  He would still  be  the gainer in the new regime even if he was taking  deduction of ` 1.5 Lakh under  various sections of Chapter- VI-A of the Income Tax Act under the old regime.  ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,·      The new tax regime shall be optional for the taxpayers. An individual who is currently availing more deductions & exemption under the Income Tax Act may choose to avail them and continue to pay tax in the old regime. ,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"·      The new personal  income tax  rates will entail  estimated revenue  forgone of ` 40,000 crore per year.  We have also initiated measures to prefill the income tax return so that  an individual who opts for the new regime would need no assistance from an expert to file his return and pay  income tax. ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"·      In order to simplify income tax system, I  have reviewed all the exemptions and deductions which got incorporated in the income tax legislation over the past several decades. It was surprising to know that currently more than one  hundred exemptions and deductions of different nature are provided in the Income-tax Act.   I have removed around  70 of  them in the  new simplified regime.   We will  review  and rationalise the remaining  exemptions and deductions in the coming years  with  a view to  further simplifying the tax system and  lowering the tax rate. ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,116.Dividend Distribution Tax ,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"Currently, companies are required to pay Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) on the dividend paid to its shareholders at the rate of 15% plus applicable surcharge and cess in addition to the tax payable by the company on its profits. ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,It has been argued that the system of levying DDT results in  increase in  tax burden for  investors  and especially those who are liable to pay tax less than the rate of DDT if the dividend income is included in their income. ,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"Further, non-availability of credit of DDT to most of the foreign investors in their home country results in reduction of rate of return on equity capital for  them. In order to increase the attractiveness of the Indian Equity Market and to  provide relief to  a large class of investors, I propose to remove the DDT and adopt the classical system of dividend taxation under which the companies would not be required to pay DDT. The dividend shall be taxed only in the hands of the recipients at their applicable rate. ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"Further, in order to remove the cascading effect, I also propose to allow deduction for the dividend received by holding company from its subsidiary.  The removal of DDT will lead to estimated annual revenue forgone of ` 25,000 Crore.",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,·       This  is another bold  move which will further make India an attractive destination for investment.,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,117.Concessional tax rate for Electricity generation companies ,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"In order to give boost to the manufacturing sector, new provisions were introduced  in September 2019 offering a concessional corporate tax rate of 15% to the newly incorporated domestic companies in the manufacturing sector which start manufacturing by 31st March, 2023.

2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"·      In order to incentivise the investment by the Sovereign Wealth Fund of  foreign governments  in the priority sectors, I propose to grant 100% tax exemption to their  interest, dividend and capital gains income  in respect of investment made in infrastructure  and other notified sectors  before 31st March, 2024 and with a minimum lock-in period of 3 years. ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"·      In order to make available foreign funds at a lower cost, I propose to extend the period of concessional withholding rate of 5% under section 194LC for interest payment to non-residents in respect of moneys borrowed and bonds issued up to 30th June, 2023. ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"·      I  also propose to extend the period up to 30th June, 2023 for lower rate of withholding of 5% under section 194LD for interest payment to  Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) and  Qualified Foreign Investors (QFIs) in respect of bonds issued by Indian companies and government securities. ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,·      I further propose to extend the concessional rate of withholding of 5% under section 194LD to the interest payment made on the Municipal Bonds.,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"·      In order to incentivise listing of bonds at IFSC exchange, I propose to  further reduce the withholding rate from 5% to 4% on interest payment on the bonds listed on  its exchange. ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,119.Start-ups,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"Start-ups have emerged as engines of growth for our economy. Over the past year, our Government has taken several measures to hand-hold them and support their growth. During their formative years, Start-ups generally use Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) to  attract  and retain  highly talented employees. ESOP is a significant component of compensation for these employees. Currently, ESOPs are taxable as perquisites at the time of exercise. This leads to cash-flow problem for the employees who do not sell the shares immediately and continue to hold the same for the long-term. In order to give a boost to the start-up ecosystem, I propose to ease the burden of taxation on the employees by deferring the tax payment  by five years or till they leave the company or when they sell their shares, whichever is earliest.  ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"Further, an eligible Start-up having turnover up to 25 crores is allowed  deduction of 100% of its the profits for three consecutive assessment years out of seven years if the total turnover  does not exceed 25 crore rupees. In order to extend this benefit to larger start-ups, I propose to increase the turnover limit from existing ` 25 crore to ` 100 crores. Moreover, considering the fact that in the initial years, a start-up may not have adequate profit to avail this deduction, I propose to extend the period of eligibility for claim of deduction from the existing 7 years to 10 years.",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,120.Concessional tax rate for Co-operatives,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"Co-operative societies play an extremely important role in our economy in facilitating access to credit, procurement of inputs and marketing of products to their members. These cooperatives are currently taxed at a rate of 30% with surcharge and cess. As a major concession and in order to bring parity between the co-operative societies and corporates, I propose to provide an option to cooperative societies to be taxed at 22% plus 10% surcharge and 4% cess with no exemption/deductions. Further, I also propose to exempt these co-operative societies from Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) just like companies under the new tax regime are exempted from the Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT).",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"121.Medium, Small and Micro Enterprises (MSME)",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"Currently, businesses having turnover of more than one crore rupees are required to get their books of accounts audited by an accountant. In order to reduce the compliance burden on small retailers, traders, shopkeepers who comprise the  MSME sector, I propose to raise by five times  the turnover threshold for audit from  the existing ` 1 crore to ` 5 crore. Further, in order to boost less cash economy, I propose that the increased limit shall apply  only to those businesses which carry out less than 5% of their business transactions in cash.     ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,122.Affordable housing ,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"For realisation of the goal of ‘Housing for All’ and affordable housing, in the last budget I had announced an additional deduction of up to one lakh fifty thousand rupees for interest paid on loans taken for purchase of an affordable house. The deduction was allowed on housing loans sanctioned on or before 31st March, 2020. In order to ensure that more persons avail this benefit and to further incentivise the affordable housing, I propose to extend the date of loan sanction  for availing this additional deduction by one more year.  ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"Further, in order to boost the supply of affordable houses in the country, a tax holiday is provided on the profits earned by developers of affordable housing project approved by 31st March, 2020. In order to promote the affordable housing projects, I propose to extend the date of approval of affordable housing projects for availing this tax holiday by one more year.   ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,123.Concession to real estate transactions,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"Currently, while taxing income from capital gains, business profits and other sources in respect of transactions in real estate, if the consideration  value is less than  circle rate by more than 5 percent, the difference  is counted as income both in the hands of the purchaser and seller.   In order to minimize hardship in real estate transaction and provide  relief to the sector, I propose to increase the limit of 5% to 10%.  ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,124. Charity institutions ,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"Acknowledging the important role played by the charitable institutions in the society, the income of these institutions is fully exempt from taxation. Further, donation made to these institutions is also allowed as deduction in computing the taxable income of the donor. ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"Currently, a taxpayer is required to fill the complete details of the donee  in the  income tax return for availing deduction.   ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"In order to ease the process of claiming deduction for donation, it is proposed to pre-fill the donee’s information in taxpayer’s return on the basis of information of donations furnished by the donee. This would result in hassle-free claim of deduction for the donation made by the taxpayer.  ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"Further, in order to claim the tax exemption, the charity institutions have to be registered with the Income Tax Department. In the past, the process of the registration was completely manual and scattered all over the country.  ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"In order to simplify the compliance for the new and existing charity institutions, I propose to make the process of registration completely electronic under which a unique registration number (URN)  shall be issued to all new and existing charity institutions. Further, to facilitate the registration of the new charity institution which is yet to start their charitable activities, I propose to allow them provisional registration for three years.    ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,125. Faceless appeals,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"Our government is committed to bringing in transformational changes so that maximum governance is provided with minimum government. In order to impart greater efficiency, transparency and accountability to the assessment process, a new faceless assessment scheme has already been introduced. Currently, most of the functions of the Income Tax Department starting from the filing of return, processing of returns, issuance of refunds and assessment are performed in the electronic mode without any human interface.  In order to take the reforms initiated by the Department to the next level and to eliminate human interface, I propose to amend the Income Tax Act so as to enable Faceless appeal on the lines of Faceless assessment. ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,126. No Dispute but Trust Scheme – ‘Vivad  Se Vishwas’Scheme,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"Sir, in the past our Government has taken several measures to reduce tax litigations. In the last budget, Sabka Vishwas Scheme was brought in to reduce litigation in indirect taxes. It  resulted in settling  over 1,89,000  cases. Currently, there are 4,83,000 direct tax cases pending in various appellate forums i.e. Commissioner (Appeals), ITAT, High Court and Supreme Court. This year, I propose to bring a scheme similar to the indirect tax Sabka Vishwas  for reducing  litigations even in  the direct taxes.  ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"Under the proposed ‘Vivad Se Vishwas’ scheme, a taxpayer would be required to pay only the amount of the disputed taxes and will get complete waiver of interest and penalty provided he pays by 31st March, 2020.  Those who avail this scheme after 31st March, 2020 will have to pay some additional amount. The scheme will remain open  till 30th June, 2020. ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,Taxpayers in whose cases appeals are pending at any level can benefit from this scheme. ,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman, I hope that taxpayers will make use of this opportunity to get relief from vexatious litigation process. ,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,127. Losses of merged banks,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"As a part of consolidation of the financial sector, our Government has brought out schemes for merger and amalgamation of public sector banks.  In order to ensure that the amalgamated entities are able to take the benefit of unabsorbed losses and depreciation of the amalgamating entities, I propose to make necessary amendments to the provisions of the Income-tax Act.",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,128. Taxpayer’s Charter,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"Any tax system requires trust between taxpayers and the administration. This will be possible  only when  taxpayer’s rights are clearly enumerated. Towards this end, and with the objective of enhancing the efficiency of the delivery system of the Income Tax Department, I propose to amend the provisions of the Income Tax Act to mandate the  Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to adopt a Taxpayers’ Charter. The details of the contents of the charter shall be notified soon.",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,129.Instant PAN through Aadhaar,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"In the last Budget, I had introduced the interchangeability of PAN and Aadhaar for which necessary rules were already notified. In order to further ease the process of allotment of PAN, soon we will launch a system under which PAN shall be instantly allotted online on the basis of Aadhaar without any requirement for filling up of detailed application form. ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"130.Our Government brought in the GST  as a historic reform of the indirect taxes in 2017. We also took a path-breaking step of simplifying and rationalising corporate tax in September, 2019.  More importantly, we offered  a rate of corporate  tax, which perhaps is the lowest in the world.  Continuing on this path,  we have now put the personal income tax at its lowest ever rate and totally removed DDT at the company’s hands. Further, the direct taxes are now the lowest, simplest, and smoothest. Direct tax  on the Start-ups also has seen  many reformatory  steps in quick succession. Even ease of compliance is seeing unprecedented changes. Last but not the least,  personal interface with tax administration is at the minimum ever.  ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,Indirect Tax,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"131.As I mentioned earlier in Part A of my speech,  reforms are continuing in GST. A simplified return shall be implemented from the 1st April, 2020. This is under pilot run. It will make return filing simple with features like SMS based filing for nil return, return pre-filling, improved input tax credit flow and overall simplification.",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,132.Refund process has been simplified and has been made fully automated with no human interface.,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,133.Electronic invoice is another innovation wherein critical information shall be captured electronically in a centralized system. It will be implemented in a phased manner starting from this month itself on optional basis. It will facilitate compliance and return filing.,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"134.Several measures have been taken for improving compliance.  Aadhaar based verification of taxpayers is being introduced. This will help in weeding out dummy or non-existent units.   Dynamic QR-code is proposed  for consumer invoices. GST parameters will be captured when payment for  purchases is made through the QR-code. A system of cash reward is envisaged to incentivise customers to seek invoice.  Deep data analytics and AI tools are being used for crackdown on GST input tax credit, refund, and other frauds and to identify all those who are trying to game the system. Invoice  and input tax credit matching is  being done wherein returns having mismatch more than 10 percent  or above a threshold are identified and pursued. Significant policy level changes have also been made. GST rate structure is also being deliberated  so as to address issues like inverted duty structure.   ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"135.On Customs side, a number of measures have been taken for ease of doing business.  India’s quantum leap in the Trading Across Border parameter of Ease of Doing Business rankings by the World Bank is a testimony to these efforts. India’s rank on this parameter improved from 146 to 80 in 2018 and further to 68 in 2019.  Measures have also been  taken for providing a level playing field to our domestic manufacturers, particularly the MSME sector and for securing borders.",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"136.It has been observed that imports under Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) are on the rise. Undue claims of FTA benefits have posed threat to domestic industry. Such imports require stringent checks. In this context, suitable provisions are being incorporated in the Customs Act. In the coming months we shall review Rules of Origin requirements, particularly for certain sensitive items, so as ensure that FTAs are aligned to the conscious  direction of our policy.",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,137.We are also strengthening provisions relating to safeguard duties which are applied when surge in imports causes serious injury to domestic industry. Amended provisions shall enable regulating such surge in imports in a systematic way.  The provisions for checking  dumping of goods and imports of subsidized goods are also being strengthened for ensuring a level playing field for domestic industry.  These changes are in line with the  international best practices.,,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"138.Exemptions from customs duty have been given in public interest from time to time. However, a number of these have outlived their utility or have become outdated. On review, certain such exemptions are being withdrawn. Remaining custom duty exemptions shall be comprehensively reviewed by September, 2020 for taking a view on their relevance. I propose to crowd source suggestions for such reviews. Suggestions would also be invited in respect of the Customs laws and procedures for   aligning them with the needs of changing times and ease of doing business.",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"139.Labour intensive sectors in MSME are critical for employment generation. Cheap and low-quality imports are an impediment  to their growth. Special attention has been taken to put measured restraint on import of those items which are being produced by our MSMEs with better quality.   Keeping in view the need of this sector, customs duty is being raised on items like footwear and furniture.",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"140.Our policy of Make in India has started giving dividends. India is now making world class goods and exporting such products. We have made considerable progress in medical equipment too. Till few years back we were dependent on imports for medical equipment.  Now, not only we are manufacturing medical equipment but also exporting them in large quantities. This sector deserves further fillip. Government has also been committed to provide health services to all. Ayushman Bharat has made it possible. To achieve the twin objectives of giving impetus to the domestic industry and also to generate resource for health services, I propose to impose a nominal health cess, by way of a duty of customs, on the imports of medical equipment keeping in view that these goods are now being made significantly in India. The proceed from this cess shall be used for creating infrastructure for health services in the aspirational districts.     ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"141.Under Make in India initiative, well laid out customs duty rates were pre-announced for items like mobile phones, electric vehicles and their components.  This has ensured gradual increase in domestic value addition capacity in India. Customs duty rates are being revised on electric vehicles, and parts of mobiles as part of such carefully conceived Phased Manufacturing Plans. ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"142.In other changes, customs duty is being reduced on certain inputs and raw materials while it is being revised upward on certain goods which are being made domestically.  In the previous budget, basic custom duty  of 10% was imposed on the news print and lightweight coated paper. However, since then I have received several references that this levy has put additional burden on print media at a time when it is going through a difficult phase. I, therefore, propose to reduce basic customs duty on imports of news print and light-weight coated paper from 10% to 5%.  ",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"143.Chemicals are crucial feed stocks for downstream users. PTA, for example, is a critical input for textile fibres and yarns.  Its easy availability at competitive prices is desirable to unlock immense potential in textile sector which is a significant employment generator.  Therefore, in the larger  public interest, anti-dumping duty on PTA is being abolished.",,,,,
2020-21,Nirmala Sitharaman,"144. As a revenue measure, I propose to raise excise duty, by way of National Calamity Contingent Duty on Cigarettes and other tobacco products. However, no change is being made in the duty rates of bidis.",,,,,

2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,,,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,"217.        In these last few paragraphs of Part A of my speech, I draw the attention of this august House to the fact that, at the beginning of the current Financial Year, the pandemic’s impact on the economy resulted in a weak revenue inflow. This was combined with high expenditure to provide essential relief to vulnerable sections of the society especially the poor, women, SCs and STs.",,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,,,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,"218.         Unlike many other countries, we opted for a series of medium-sized packages during the pandemic so that we could calibrate and target our response according to an evolving situation. Once the health situation stabilised, and the lockdown was being slowly lifted, we switched to ramping up Government spending so as to revive domestic demand. As a result, against an original BE expenditure of `30.42 lakh crores for 2020-2021, our RE estimates are `34.50 lakh crores. We have maintained the quality of expenditure. The capital expenditure, estimated in RE is `4.39 lakh crores in 2020-2021 as against `4.12 lakh crores in BE 2020-21.",,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,,,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,"219.        The fiscal deficit in RE 2020-21 is pegged at 9.5% of GDP. We have funded this through Government borrowings, multilateral borrowings, Small Saving Funds and short term borrowings. We would need another ` 80,000 crores for which we would be approaching the markets in these 2 months. To ensure that the economy is given the required push, our BE estimates for expenditure in 2021-2022, are `34.83lakh crores. This includes `5.54lakh crores as capital expenditure, an increase of 34.5% over the BE figure of 2020-2021. The fiscal deficit in BE 2021-2022 is estimated to be 6.8% of GDP. The gross borrowing from the market for the next year would be around `12 lakh crores. We plan to continue with our path of fiscal consolidation, and intend to reach a fiscal deficit level below 4.5% of GDP by 2025-2026 with a fairly steady decline over the period. We hope to achieve the consolidation by first, increasing the buoyancy of tax revenue through improved compliance, and secondly, by increased receipts from monetisation of assets, including Public Sector Enterprises and land. The Contingency Fund of India is being proposed to be augmented from `500 crores to `30,000 crores through Finance Bill.",,,,,

2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,"221.        In accordance with the views of the 15th Finance Commission, we are allowing a normal ceiling of net borrowing for the states at 4% of GSDP for the year 2021-2022. A portion of this ceiling will be earmarked to be spent on incremental capital expenditure. Additional borrowing ceiling of 0.5% of GSDP will also be provided subject to conditions. States will be expected to reach a fiscal deficit of 3% of GSDP by 2023-24, as recommended by the 15th Finance Commission.",,,,,

In my 2020-2021 Budget, I enhanced the scope and coverage of the Statement, by including the loans provided by Government to the FCI. Taking a step further in this direction, I   propose to discontinue the NSSF Loan to FCI for Food Subsidy and accordingly Budget Provisions have been made in RE 2020-21 and BE 2021-22. The Extra Budgetary Resources details are at Annexure VI.",,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,223.        We know that the FRBM Act mandates fiscal deficit of 3% of GDP to be achieved by 31st March 2020-2021.

The Government has laid the Commission’s report, along with the explanatory memorandum in the Parliament retaining the vertical shares of the states at 41%. We recognise our commitment to fiscal federalism and propose therefore to adhere to this recommendation. Jammu and Kashmir in the 14th Finance Commission was entitled to get devolution being a State. Now, the funds to the UTs of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh would be provided by the Centre.I have also provided, on the Commission’s recommendation, `1,18,452crores as Revenue Deficit Grant to 17 states in 2021-2022, as against `74,340 crores to 14 States in 2020-2021.

2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,231.       Direct Tax Proposals,,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,"232.        Keeping this in mind, our Government introduced a series of reforms in the Direct tax system for the benefit of our taxpayers and economy.  Few months prior to the pandemic,  in order to attract investments  we slashed our Corporate tax rate to make it among the lowest in the world. The Dividend Distribution Tax too was abolished. The burden of taxation on small taxpayers was eased by increasing rebates. In 2020, the return filers saw a dramatic increase to 6.48crorefrom 3.31 crorein 2014.",,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,,,,,,

2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,"236.        Now in the 75th year of Independence of our country, when we continue our  endeavour with renewed vigour, we shall reduce compliance burden on our senior citizens who are 75 years of age and above. For senior citizens who only have pension and interest income, I propose exemption from filing their income tax returns. The paying bank will deduct the necessary tax on their income.",,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,,,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,237.       Reduction in Time for Income Tax Proceedings,,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,"238.        Honourable Speaker, presently, an assessment can be re-opened up to 6 years and in serious tax fraud cases for up to 10 years. As a result, taxpayers have to remain under uncertainty for a long time.",,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,,,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,"239.        I therefore propose to reduce this time-limit for re-opening of assessment to 3 years from the present 6 years. In serious tax evasion cases too, only where there is evidence of concealment of income of `50 lakh or more in a year, can the assessment be re-opened up to 10 years. Even this reopening can be done only after the approval of the Principal Chief Commissioner, the highest level of the Income Tax Department.",,,,,

2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,,,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,"242.        The Government came out with the Direct Tax Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme to give taxpayers an opportunity to settle long pending disputes and be relieved of further strain on their time and resources. The response  from the taxpayers has been the best ever as  over 1 lakh ten thousand  taxpayers have already opted to settle tax disputes of over `85,000 croresunder this Scheme.",,,,,

2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,,,,,,

2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,,,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,"247.        The next level of income tax appeal is the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal.  I now propose to make this Tribunal faceless.

2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,"249.        When Non-Resident Indians return to India, they have issues with respect to their accrued incomes in their foreign retirement accounts. This is usually due to a mismatch in taxation periods.  They also face difficulties in getting credit for Indian taxes in foreign jurisdictions. I propose to notify rules for removing their hardship of double taxation.",,,,,

2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,250.       Exemption from Audit,,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,"251.        Currently, if your turnover exceeds  `1 crore, you have to get your accounts audited. In the February 2020 Budget, I had increased the limit for tax audit to  `5 crore for those who carry out 95% of their transactions digitally. To further incentivise digital transactions and reduce compliance burden, I propose to increase this limit for tax audit for such persons from  `5 crore to  `10 crore.",,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,252.       Relief for Dividend,,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,"253.        In the previous Budget, I had abolished the Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) in order to incentivise investment. Dividend was made taxable in the hands of shareholders. Now, in order to provide ease of compliance, I propose to make dividend payment to REIT/ InvIT exempt from TDS. Further, as the amount of dividend income cannot be estimated correctly by the shareholders for paying advance tax, I propose to provide that advance tax liability on dividend income shall arise only after the declaration/payment of dividend. Also, for Foreign Portfolio Investors, I propose to enable deduction of tax on dividend income at lower treaty rate. ",,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,254.       Attracting foreign investment into infrastructure sector,,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,"255.        In the last budget, for attracting foreign investment in the infrastructure sector, we had granted 100% tax exemption, subject to certain conditions, to foreign Sovereign Wealth Funds and Pension Funds, on their income from investment in Indian infrastructure. We have noticed that few of such Funds are facing difficulties in meeting some of these conditions. In order to ensure that a large number of Funds invest in India, I propose to relax some of these conditions relating to prohibition on private funding, restriction on commercial activities, and direct investment in infrastructure.    ",,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,,,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,"256.        In order to allow funding of infrastructure by issue of Zero Coupon Bonds, I propose to make notified Infrastructure Debt Funds eligible to raise funds by issuing tax efficient Zero Coupon Bonds. ",,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,,,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,257.       Affordable Housing/Rental Housing,,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,"258.        This Government sees ‘Housing for All’ and affordable housing as priority areas. In the July 2019 Budget, I provided an additional deduction of interest, amounting to  `1.5 lakh, for loan taken to purchase an affordable house. I propose to extend the eligibility of this deduction by one more year, to 31st March 2022. The additional deduction of  `1.5 lakh shall therefore be available for loans taken up till 31st March 2022, for the purchase of an affordable house.",,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,,,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,"259.        Further, to keep up the supply of affordable houses, I propose that affordable housing projects can avail a tax holiday for one more year – till 31st March, 2022.",,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,,,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,"260.        We are committed to promote supply of Affordable Rental Housing for migrant workers. For this, I propose to allow  tax exemption for notified Affordable Rental Housing Projects. ",,,,,

2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,"262.        As I mentioned in Part A of this speech, the Government is committed to make the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in GIFT City a global financial hub. In addition to the tax incentives already provided, I propose to include, among others, tax holiday for capital gains for aircraft leasing companies, tax exemption for aircraft lease rentals paid to foreign lessors; tax incentive for relocating foreign funds in the IFSC; and to  allow tax exemption to the investment division of foreign banks located in IFSC. ",,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,263.       Pre-filling of Returns,,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,"264.        Honourable Speaker, in order to ease compliance for the taxpayer, details of salary income, tax payments, TDS, etc. already come pre-filled in income tax returns. To further ease filing of returns, details of capital gains from listed securities, dividend income, and interest from banks, post office, etc. will also be pre-filled.",,,,,

2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,267.        Labour Welfare,,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,"268.        We have noticed that some employers deduct the contribution of employees towards  Provident funds, superannuation funds,  and other social security funds but do not deposit these contributions within the specified time. For the employees, this means a loss of interest or income. In cases where an employer later becomes financially unviable, non-deposit results in a permanent loss for the employees.",,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,"269.        In order to ensure that employees’ contributions are deposited on time, I reiterate that the late deposit of employee’s contribution by the employer will not be allowed as deduction to the employer.",,,,,

Further, in order to incentivise funding of the start-ups, I propose to extend the capital gains exemption for investment in start-ups by one more year - till 31st March, 2022.",,,,,

2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,284.       Custom Duty Rationalization,,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,285.        Our Custom Duty Policy should have the twin objective of promoting domestic manufacturing and helping India get onto global value chain and export better. The thrust now has to be on easy access to raw materials and exports of value added products.,,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,,,,,,
2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,"286.        Towards this, last year, we started overhauling the Customs Duty structure, eliminating 80 outdated exemptions.  I also thank everyone who responded overwhelmingly to a crowd-sourcing call for suggestions on this revamp. I now propose to review more than 400 old exemptions this year.  We will conduct this through extensive consultations, and from 1st October 2021, we will put in place a revised customs duty structure, free of distortions.

Therefore, we are reducing Customs duty uniformly to 7.5% on semis, flat, and long products of non-alloy, alloy, and stainless steels. To provide relief to metal re-cyclers, mostly MSMEs, I am exempting duty on steel scrap for a period up to 31st March, 2022.  Further, I am also revoking ADD and CVD on certain steel products.

2021-22,Nirmala Sitharaman,"307.        For their judicious application, we propose certain changes in the provisions relating to ADD and CVD levies.

To provide equal treatment to both Central and State government employees, I propose to increase the tax deduction limit from 10 per cent to 14 per cent on employer’s contribution to the NPS account of State Government employees as well. This would help in enhancing the social security benefits of the state government employees and bring them at par with central government employees.",,,,,

These challenges were overcome deftly and painstakingly under the guidance and oversight of the GST Council.  We can now take pride in a fully IT driven and progressive GST regime that has fulfilled the cherished dream of India as one market- one tax. There are still some challenges remaining and we aspire to meet them in the coming year. The right balance between facilitation and enforcement has engendered significantly better compliance.

During Covid-19 pandemic, Customs formations have done exceptional frontline work against all odds displaying agility and purpose. Customs’ reforms have played a very vital role in domestic capacity creation, providing level playing field to our MSMEs, easing the raw material supply side constraints, enhancing ease of doing business and being an enabler to other policy initiatives such as PLIs and Phased Manufacturing Plans.

This would create employment opportunities and result in increased economic activity. However, several duty exemptions, even extending to over three decades in some cases, have been granted to capital goods for various sectors like power, fertilizer, textiles, leather, footwear, food processin­­­g and fertilizers. These exemptions have hindered the growth of the domestic capital goods sector.  ",,,,,
2022-23,Nirmala Sitharaman,"Similarly, project import duty concessions have also deprived the local producers of a level playing field in areas like coal mining projects, power generation, transmission or distribution projects, railway and metro projects.

These include exemption on certain agricultural produce, chemicals, fabrics, medical devices and drugs and medicines for which sufficient domestic capacity exists.  Further, as a simplification measure, several concessional rates are being incorporated in the Customs Tariff Schedule itself instead of prescribing them through various notifications.  ",,,,,
2022-23,Nirmala Sitharaman,"This comprehensive review will simplify the Customs rate and tariff structure particularly for sectors like chemicals, textiles and metals and minimise disputes.
