8,"Despite the focus on populist measures due to the coalition government, the budget is expected to maintain a path of fiscal consolidation, aiming to reduce the fiscal deficit to 5.1% of GDP for FY25 and further to 4.5% by FY26​"
9,"The upcoming Indian budget for 2024 is expected to bring several changes and developments in the country's economy. According to ICRA, a credit rating agency, the government is likely to scale down the fiscal deficit target to 5% or less in the budget. This reduction in the fiscal deficit will be aided by revenue buoyancy and is expected to contribute to a more stable economic environment."
10,The Union Budget will be the first after the Lok Sabha election that saw a third term of the Modi government. The Indian Chamber of Commerce wants rationalisation of customs duties to boost Indian manufacturing sector. India's food subsidies may cost 11 per cent more than the initial plan.
11,"Expectations are high for sustained high capital expenditure on infrastructure sectors like roads powerurban development, and railways, said the brokerage. This strategic allocation aims to stimulate economic growth, create employment opportunities, and foster long-term economic multipliers. The BJP manifesto emphasises robust infrastructure development, aligning with recent interim budget highlights that underscore fiscal prudence with a maintained fiscal deficit target of 5.1 percent. As per Fisdom, key stocks to monitor include Larsen & Toubro (L&T), KNR Constructions, and PNC Infratech, poised to benefit from increased infrastructure investments."

13,"Union Budget 2024: Experts call for enhancement of deduction limit under 80C, simpler terms for capital gains tax. Experts recommend raising the Section 80C limit in the upcoming budget. This adjustment would provide relief to the middle class facing rising costs and insufficient tax exemptions."
14,"it is expected that the current government will continue its higher capex-fuelled spending strategy, despite its failure to substantially boost private investment levels over the last few years. This was executed at the cost of revenue expenditure needs (see the decline observed in year-on-year government spending on critical social welfare programs)."
15,"For the upcoming budget to truly make a difference, it must prioritise substantial investments in technology and infrastructure for skill-providing institutions. We need to see a concerted effort to upgrade computer labs, ensure widespread access to high-speed internet, and provide robust training programs for digital skills. By doing so, we can better prepare our future workforce to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving job market.Furthermore, it is crucial not only to enhance infrastructure but also to ensure that skill development initiatives are closely aligned with industry needs. The rapid pace of technological change means that the skills required today may not be the same as those needed tomorrow. Therefore, ongoing collaboration between skill-providing institutions and industry players is essential to keep curricula relevant and impactful."
16,"Meanwhile, job creation remains a critical aspect that the budget must address. While skill development is paramount, these skills must translate into actual employment opportunities for the workforce. The government has made commendable strides in promoting start-ups and entrepreneurship. For instance, the budget 2023 introduced tax incentives for start-ups, including a three-year tax holiday for new companies and the extension of the period of incorporation for eligible start-ups by one year."
17,"The 2024 Lok Sabha elections seem to indicate the return of state-wise differentiated voter behaviour. The result has pointers on fiscal federalism, job creation and private capital spending that finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman may consider."
18,"The standard deduction, a straightforward reduction from taxable income under the 'salaries' category, currently requires no additional disclosures or proof of investment. Despite expectations for an increase, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has indicated that significant changes will be considered only in the full Budget.
In its list of changes in the upcoming Budget, consultancy firm KPMG sees doubling standard deduction, increasing the tax break on interest paid on housing loans, and rationalizing the capital gains tax regime."
19,"The government might consider raising the standard deduction to at least ₹1 lakh, streamline tax slabs, taxation of employer contributions and ESOPs tax while giving a higher allocation of capital expenditure with a focus on boosting rural sector demand in the Union Budget, experts believe."
20,"Some of the key demands of employee unions are to set up the 8th Pay Commission, restore the Old Pension Scheme and fill up existing job vacancies. Economists at Goldman Sachs expect the budget to push labour intensive manufacturing through fiscal incentives across sectors like toys, textiles and apparel manufacturing, along with commercial aircraft manufacturing. Santanu Sengupta, chief India economist wrote in a note: ""We see an emphasis on job creation through labor-intensive manufacturing, credit for micro, small and medium enterprises, continued focus on services exports by expanding global capability centres, and a thrust on domestic food supply chain."""
21,"Meanwhile, amid push for Artificial Intelligence in various sectors, recommendations have also been made to the FM to include provisions in the budget that can help re-skill and rehabilitate workers impacted by the use of AI. A proposal for ‘robot tax’ was one such recommendation given by RSS’s associate organisations like the Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) and Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), at a recent meeting of economists with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman."
22," Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, despite losing seats in the recent general election, secured a third term. His alliance partners are now seeking significant federal funding for regional development projects, challenging Modi's fiscal conservatism. India's inclusion in global bond indices may ease borrowing costs but also demands greater transparency and fiscal responsibility to maintain economic stability."
23," there’s agreement on the direction of India’s deficit: downwards. Modi needs to preserve that trust, even when faced with new demands from pesky regional parties.Such pressures are, after all, only part of the strains that India’s budget will have to address. Most politicians interpreted the unexpected election results as a sign that India’s job shortage was beginning to bite. The government will be tempted to respond by being more generous — for example, by expanding the number of make-work public sector jobs available to India’s vast army of unemployed youth."
24,"The government is considering a change in the holding period for computing capital gains tax on immovable assets such as real estate to bring about uniformity, ET has reported based on information from sources. Currently, any capital gain from the sale of real estate held for 24 months or less is treated as a short-term capital gain. In contrast, the holding period threshold for listed equities and equity mutual funds is 12 months. Reducing the holding period may bring more properties to market "

The body stated that these recommendations aim to address existing challenges and stimulate growth in the real estate sector, ultimately contributing to the government’s goal of ‘Housing for All’."
27,"Some needy sectors like agriculture, infrastructure, and MSMEs got budgetary policy interventions, although it can be debated whether the measures were adequate enough. Besides, the expenditure profile, based on the previous years' budget documents, indicates that job creation has been the top most priority for the government. In particular, the NDA government's fiscal policy choices have come under sharp focus, even as expectations are mounting that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman may do things differently when she presents the FY25 budget on July 23."
28,"While we await the actual announcements, it's speculated that the government is considering a pretty wide range of things to do. From lowering rates for certain categories of individual income earners to boost consumption to raising the annual cash dole to small farmers from Rs 6,000 to Rs 8,000, to increasing payments under the minimum job guarantee programme, and so on. There's talk of introducing a new tax bracket even, besides increasing the current limit of deduction under section 80C to Rs 2 lakh from Rs 1.5 lakh. It has remained unchanged since 2014 and the much-needed revision will be a crowd-pleaser.

However, Sitharaman is likely to adhere to the interim budget's fiscal deficit targets. Budget"
